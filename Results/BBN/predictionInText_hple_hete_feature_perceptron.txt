WSJ1829:0	[Silicon Valley] :[/LOCATION] heaved a sigh of relief yesterday .

WSJ1829:1	Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the [San Francisco Bay] :[/FACILITY] area , a spot check of computer makers turned up little , if any , potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment .

WSJ1829:2	Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the [Valley] :[/LOCATION] of either hardware or software goods .

WSJ1829:3	[Intel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Advanced Micro Devices Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [National Semiconductor Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] were all up and running yesterday , though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways ; others elected to take the day off .

WSJ1829:4	`` These systems are more rugged than many people would believe , '' said [Thomas Kurlak] :[/PERSON] , who tracks the computer industry for [Merrill Lynch Research] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1829:6	Other companies , including [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Hewlett-Packard Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening 's temblor , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .

WSJ1829:7	Personnel spent the morning inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses , mopping up [water] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors .

WSJ1829:8	Still , many were confident that `` in a day or two , everything should be back to normal , '' according to a spokeswoman for the [Semiconductor Industry Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , based in [Cupertino] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1829:9	[IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for instance , said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its [San Jose] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] plant , which puts out disk drives for the [3090] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] family of mainframes .

WSJ1829:10	A [Hewlett-Packard] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman said that , while `` things are a big mess , '' some 18,000 [Valley] :[/LOCATION] employees have been called back to work today .

WSJ1829:11	[Apple Computer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] added that it was being `` cautiously optimistic , '' despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region .

WSJ1829:12	Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant [Fremont] :[/GPE] plant , to the north of the [Valley] :[/LOCATION] , was believed to be undamaged .

WSJ1829:13	[Sun Microsystems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Tandem Computers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also signaled that they should recover quickly .

WSJ1829:14	[Digital Equipment Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , with major facilities in [Santa Clara] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Cupertino] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Palo Alto] :[/GPE] and [Mountain View] :[/GPE] , said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in [Maynard] :[/PERSON] , Mass . , Tuesday night .

WSJ1829:17	For example , a spokesman for [Advanced Micro Devices] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the [Sunnyvale] :[/GPE] chip maker is worried about blackouts .

WSJ1829:19	But , given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business , the bulk of [Valley] :[/LOCATION] companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas .

WSJ1829:20	Several factors apparently spared the [Valley] :[/LOCATION] -- a sprawling suburban stretch from [San Jose] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to [Palo Alto] :[/GPE] -- from the kind of impact felt in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , an hour 's drive north .

WSJ1829:22	Also , the soil in the [Valley] :[/LOCATION] is solid , unlike the landfill of [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's downtown [Marina District] :[/LOCATION] , which was hit with fires and vast destruction .

WSJ1829:25	[Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said that over the past decade , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its plants .

WSJ1829:26	Like other large [Valley] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] companies , [Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION] also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation , so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total pinch .

WSJ1829:27	That 's certainly good news for such companies as [Compaq Computer Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the [Valley] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .

WSJ1829:28	[Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future .

WSJ1829:30	[Digital Equipment] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has set up disaster-recovery response centers in [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Atlanta] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Colorado Springs] :[/GPE] , [Colo .] :[/GPE]

WSJ1829:31	These units were handling calls both from people in the [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] area and from computers themselves , which are set to dial [Digital] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] automatically when trouble arises .

WSJ1829:33	[Digital] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1829:34	Meanwhile , several other major installations around the [Valley] :[/LOCATION] -- [America] :[/LOCATION] 's center of high-tech -- said they , too , fared as well as could be expected .

WSJ1829:35	[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory] , where the [Energy Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons , had only `` superficial damage , '' a spokesman said .

WSJ1829:36	At [Lockheed Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's missiles and space systems group in [Sunnyvale] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , about 40 miles south of [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that `` there were no show-stoppers '' in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus .

WSJ1829:38	One of [Lockheed] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's most lucrative sectors -- accounting for more than half the aerospace company 's $ 10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime [Pentagon] :[/FACILITY] contractor on the [Trident II] :[/EVENT] ballistic missile .

WSJ1829:39	It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the [Strategic Defense Initiative] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1829:40	Fortunately , the [Hubble Space Telescope] -- set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from [Sunnyvale] :[/ORGANIZATION] to the [Kennedy Space Center] in [Florida] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] at the beginning of October .

WSJ1829:41	[John R. Wilke] :[/PERSON] contribued to this article .

WSJ1839:0	Rep. [Mary Rose Oakar] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) at last week 's hearings on irregularities in programs at the [Department of Housing and Urban Development] :[/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY] :

WSJ1839:2	And if I think that some people { on [HUD] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Jack Kemp] :[/PERSON] 's } staff are off base in terms in which they 're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown , I have to tell you something -- I 'm not going to take it .

WSJ1840:0	The [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it fined [Capcom Futures Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] $ 500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm .

WSJ1840:1	[Capcom Futures] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] subsidiary of [Capcom Financial Services Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money .

WSJ1840:3	The firm was indicted in [Tampa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Fla.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , on money-laundering charges .

WSJ1840:4	In June , the [Chicago Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] said it suspended [Capcom Financial] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1840:5	The [Capcom Futures] :[/ORGANIZATION] unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August , a [Board of Trade] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/LAW,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] spokesman said .

WSJ1840:6	[Capcom Futures] :[/ORGANIZATION] , while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges , said in a statement that the Merc charges were `` technical in nature '' and that `` no customers were hurt '' as a result of the violations cited by the [Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] .

WSJ1840:7	The [Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] alleged that , among other things , from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled by [Capcom Futures] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] shareholders .

WSJ1844:0	[Della Femina McNamee WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] agency created liar [Joe Isuzu] :[/PERSON] , among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:1	[WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] from primarily a creator of advertising into one of [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] 's largest buyers of advertising time and space .

WSJ1844:2	It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and headed jointly by [New York] :[/GPE] ad man [Jerry Della Femina] :[/PERSON] and two top [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] executives .

WSJ1844:4	[WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk .

WSJ1844:5	For [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , the move gives it a strong [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] foothold in [Della Femina] :[/PERSON] , and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide .

WSJ1844:6	It also gives the outspoken Mr. [Della Femina] :[/WORK_OF_ART] -- who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients -- an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use .

WSJ1844:7	According to terms , [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will pay 2.02 billion French francs ( $ 318.6 million ) for the 50 % it does n't already own of [Carat Holding S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , one of [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] 's largest media buyers .

WSJ1844:8	Meanwhile , [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which had held 20 % of [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's ad unit , will pay # 43.5 million ( $ 68.5 million ) to raise its stake to 60 % .

WSJ1844:9	That price also covers [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] raising to 60 % its 51 % stake in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] 's [Belier Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a joint venture ad agency network it owns with [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:10	[Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will also have the right to buy the remaining 40 % of the merged ad agency group in six years .

WSJ1844:11	The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of [Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , or [EWDB] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1844:12	The merged agency will include [Della Femina McNamee] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] based in [New York] :[/GPE] , [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's various agencies in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the [Belier Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] and [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's other advertising and direct marketing operations .

WSJ1844:13	Mr. [Della Femina] :[/PERSON] will be joint chairman with former [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] executive [Robin Wight] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ1844:14	Both will report to [Tim Breene] :[/PERSON] , a former [WCRS] :[/PERSON] executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency .

WSJ1844:15	In an interview in [New York] :[/GPE] , Mr. [Breene] :[/PERSON] , fresh from a [Concorde] :[/GPE] flight from [Paris] :[/GPE] where executives had worked through most of the night , outlined big plans for the new agency .

WSJ1844:18	He added that [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had agreed to provide a development fund of # 100 million for acquisitions .

WSJ1844:19	The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in [Spain] :[/GPE] , while Mr. [Breene] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said it also plans to make acquisitions in [Scandinavia] :[/LOCATION] , [Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and elsewhere .

WSJ1844:21	[Della Femina] :[/WORK_OF_ART] had billings of just $ 660 million last year and ranked as the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's 24th-largest ad agency .

WSJ1844:22	The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $ 2.6 billion -- most of that in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide .

WSJ1844:23	[Grey Advertising] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , D'Arcy Masius Benton & amp ; Bowles and [Omnicom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [DDB Needham] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:25	When [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] created [Della Femina McNamee] :[/WORK_OF_ART] out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 , it said it did so in order to attract larger clients , especially packaged-goods companies .

WSJ1844:26	Since then , [Della Femina] :[/WORK_OF_ART] won [Pan Am] :[/ORGANIZATION] as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients , including [Dow Chemical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Saran Wrap] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:27	[Colgate-Palmolive] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- have steadfastly eluded the agency .

WSJ1844:29	Still , the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that [Europe] :[/LOCATION] has seen .

WSJ1844:30	As part of the restructuring , [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION] said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across [Europe] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1844:31	What 's more , both Eurocom and brothers [Francis] :[/PERSON] and [Gilbert Gross] :[/PERSON] , who founded Carat , will acquire 14.99 % stakes in [WCRS Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , creating a powerful link between [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:32	Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50 % [Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stake that WCRS is buying , while [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it expects to pay about # 32 million for its [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stake .

WSJ1844:33	Mr. [Della Femina] :[/PERSON] says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency , serving as a sort of `` creative conscience . ''

WSJ1844:34	[Louise McNamee] :[/PERSON] , [Della Femina] :[/WORK_OF_ART] 's president , will continue running the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] agency day-to-day .

WSJ1844:35	They and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and Mr. [Della Femina] :[/PERSON] will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum , which some industry executives pegged at about $ 10 million .

WSJ1844:36	[WCRS Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for its part , will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming `` a holding company for a series of media-related businesses , '' said [Peter Scott] :[/PERSON] , the firm 's chief executive .

WSJ1844:37	In addition to [Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] will hold onto its public relations , TV programming and other businesses .

WSJ1844:38	[WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] says its debt will be cut to # 24 million from # 66 million as a result of the transaction .

WSJ1844:39	For [Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , the alliance with [Eurocom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] is intended to strengthen its own push outside [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1844:40	[Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Gross] :[/PERSON] brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space .

WSJ1844:42	They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as [Coca-Cola Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Fiat S.p . A.] :[/PERSON] , [Gillette] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Kodak] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:43	But now , other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and [Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wants to expand to the rest of [Europe] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1844:44	To help finance the [Carat] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] purchase , [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it plans an issue of [Euroconvertible] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] preferred shares once the market settles down .

WSJ1844:45	[WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] added that `` in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets , '' it has arranged medium-term debt financing , which would be underwritten by Samuel Montagu & amp ; Co. Ltd .

WSJ1844:47	Tuesday 's earthquake brought the [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday , with only a few staffers showing up at their offices , mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new-business presentations .

WSJ1844:48	While no agencies reported injuries to employees , the quake damaged the offices of [J. Walter Thompson] :[/LOCATION] , [Chiat\/Day\/Mojo] :[/PERSON] and [DDB Needham] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , among others , spokesmen for those agencies said .

WSJ1844:49	Staffers at [Thompson] :[/LOCATION] , whose offices are in the ultramodern [Embarcadero Center] , watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet , according to a spokeswoman .

WSJ1844:50	Plaster fell and windows were broken at [Chiat\/Day\/Mojo] :[/PERSON] , a spokesman for that agency said .

WSJ1844:51	Late yesterday afternoon , [DDB Needham] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives were scrambling to figure out what to do about a new business presentation that had been scheduled for today , a spokesman said .

WSJ1844:52	[DDB Needham] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's office building may have sustained structural damage , the spokesman added .

WSJ1844:54	[Thompson and Foote] :[/PERSON] , Cone & amp ; Belding , said some employees who live outside of [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , fearful that they would n't be able to get home , spent the night at the agency .

WSJ1844:57	[Chesebrough-Pond 's Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Greenwich] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , awarded its [Faberge] :[/PERSON] hair care accounts to [J. Walter Thompson] :[/PERSON] , [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1844:58	[Thompson] :[/LOCATION] , a unit of [WPP Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , will handle [Faberge Organic] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shampoo and conditioner and [Aqua Net] :[/ORGANIZATION] hairspray .

WSJ1844:59	The accounts , which billed about $ 7 million last year , according to [Leading National Advertisers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , were previously handled at [Bozell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1844:61	[William Morrissey] :[/PERSON] , 44 , was named executive vice president , world-wide director of [McCann Direct] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the direct marketing unit of [Interpublic Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [McCann-Erickson] :[/PERSON] agency .

WSJ1844:70	[Sibra Products Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Greenwich] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , awarded its [Cardinal Amber Light] :[/ORGANIZATION] [beer] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] account to Heidelberg & amp ; Associates , [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1844:71	[Budget] :[/ORGANIZATION] is set at $ 1.5 million .

WSJ1844:73	[Heidelberg] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's first ads for the brand , which [Sibra] :[/ORGANIZATION] says will compete with imported light beer leader [Amstel Light] :[/PERSON] , feature the line `` The best tasting light [beer] :[/SUBSTANCE] you 've ever seen .

WSJ1845:0	[Diamond-Star Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a joint venture of [Chrysler Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Mitsubishi Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will begin shipping [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Eclipse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] cars to Japan next week , emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S.-built vehicles back to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1845:1	[Diamond-Star] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it will export about 1,500 [Eclipse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] cars to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] by year 's end .

WSJ1845:2	[Honda Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the first Japanese auto maker to ship cars to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] from the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , is now exporting more than 5,000 [Accord Coupes] :[/SUBSTANCE] a year from its [Marysville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , factory .

WSJ1848:0	[Randy Delchamps] :[/PERSON] was named chairman and chief executive officer of this grocery chain .

WSJ1848:1	Mr. Delchamps , 46 years old , succeeds A.F . [Delchamps] :[/PERSON] Jr. , who died in a plane crash on Sunday at the age of 58 .

WSJ1848:2	[Randy Delchamps] :[/PERSON] retains his position as president .

WSJ1690:0	[William Bennett] :[/PERSON] , the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] drug-policy director , accused local officials in the [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers .

WSJ1690:1	`` Politics has essentially put up a roadblock '' to finding sites for new federal prisons , Mr. [Bennett] :[/PERSON] said at a news conference called to report on his `` emergency assistance program '' for the capital .

WSJ1690:2	Without more space to incarcerate convicted criminals , he added , `` we will not win the war on [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] . ''

WSJ1690:3	Mr. [Bennett] :[/PERSON] declared in April that he would make [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] a `` test case '' for how the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration would aid cities afflicted by heavy drug trafficking and violence .

WSJ1690:5	He acknowledged , however , that [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's `` drug-related murder rate is intolerably high .

WSJ1690:7	[Drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] continue to be sold openly around schools , parks and housing projects . ''

WSJ1690:8	Mr. [Bennett] :[/PERSON] declined to name the area officials who he believes have impeded plans for building more federal prisons to ease [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's problem .

WSJ1690:9	But other [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration officials have criticized [Maryland] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] Gov . [William Schaefer] :[/PERSON] for blocking the use of possible sites in that state .

WSJ1690:10	Administration officials also have said that [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] Mayor [Marion Barry] :[/PERSON] has delayed consideration of sites in the city .

WSJ1690:11	In a letter to Mr. [Bennett] :[/PERSON] 's office , released yesterday , [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's city administrator , [Carol Thompson] :[/LOCATION] , complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital .

WSJ1690:13	Of his successes in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mr. [Bennett] :[/PERSON] stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates .

WSJ1690:14	He also noted that the federal [Drug Enforcement Administration] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $ 2 million in seizures of [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE] dealers ' assets .

WSJ1690:15	The [Defense Department] :[/ORGANIZATION] has lent the [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] attorney 10 prosecutors , and the [Federal Bureau of Investigation] :[/ORGANIZATION] has provided crime laboratory facilities and training , he added .

WSJ1400:0	[CRI Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its [Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 .

WSJ1400:1	The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs , said [Jay R. Cohen] :[/PERSON] , [Champs] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] executive vice president .

WSJ1407:0	A former [Sperry Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] marketing executive , admitting his role in the [Pentagon] :[/FACILITY] procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] acquisition official during the early 1980s .

WSJ1407:1	[Frank Lavelle] :[/PERSON] , who at the time was the marketing director for [Sperry] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Clearwater] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Fla.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe [Garland Tomlin] :[/PERSON] , the [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] official .

WSJ1407:2	Mr. [Tomlin] :[/PERSON] , who left the [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION] in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges .

WSJ1407:3	The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. [Lavelle] :[/PERSON] 's guilty plea in federal district court in [Alexandria] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Va] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1407:4	[Sperry] :[/ORGANIZATION] merged with [Burroughs Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] to become [Unisys Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in late 1986 .

WSJ1407:5	Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. [Tomlin] :[/PERSON] tried to steer to [Sperry] :[/ORGANIZATION] a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] electronics equiment .

WSJ1407:6	Mr. [Tomlin] :[/PERSON] , among other things , illegally provided Mr. [Lavelle] :[/PERSON] with inside information and documents intended to give [Sperry] :[/ORGANIZATION] an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said .

WSJ1407:7	[Sperry] :[/ORGANIZATION] ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work .

WSJ1407:8	Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. [Lavelle] :[/PERSON] and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained `` approval of the scheme '' from more-senior [Sperry] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials `` because the payment which { Mr . } [Tomlin] :[/PERSON] requested was so large . ''

WSJ1407:9	[Charles Gardner] :[/PERSON] , a former [Unisys] :[/ORGANIZATION] vice president , and [James Neal] :[/PERSON] , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes .

WSJ1407:10	[Unisys] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company .

WSJ1407:11	Mr. [Lavelle] :[/PERSON] faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine .

WSJ1408:0	The [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] said a seat was sold for $ 500,000 , unchanged from the sale Thursday .

WSJ1421:0	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Finance Ministry] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] strongly denied playing any role in the [New York] :[/GPE] stock-price free fall .

WSJ1421:1	[Makoto Utsumi] :[/PERSON] , vice minister for international affairs , said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] leveraged buy-out .

WSJ1421:2	The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general , Mr. [Utsumi] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1421:4	The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets .

WSJ1421:5	A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in [New York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] deal for one reason or another .

WSJ1421:6	Mr. [Utsumi] :[/PERSON] said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about `` the status of their participation '' in one previous [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] leveraged buy-out .

WSJ1421:7	The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. [Utsumi] :[/PERSON] declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . ''

WSJ1421:9	Mr. [Utsumi] :[/PERSON] also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out .

WSJ1421:10	In general , Mr. [Utsumi] :[/PERSON] said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals .

WSJ1421:14	[Sanwa Bank Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is one Japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] proposal .

WSJ1421:15	A [Sanwa Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision .

WSJ1421:17	Still , Mr. [Utsumi] :[/PERSON] may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks .

WSJ1421:18	All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and abroad about the ministry 's real position .

WSJ1421:22	Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .

WSJ1421:26	At a news conference this week , [Bank of Japan] :[/ORGANIZATION] Gov . [Satoshi Sumita] :[/PERSON] cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .

WSJ1421:27	Despite Mr. [Sumita] :[/PERSON] 's statements , it is the [Finance Ministry] :[/ORGANIZATION] , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions .

WSJ1421:29	Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the [U.S.] :[/GPE] market , bank analysts say .

WSJ0682:0	Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July 's crash of a [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] flight in [Iowa] :[/GPE] : a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk .

WSJ0682:1	For several months , officials at the [Federal Aviation Administration] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [National Transportation Safety Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight .

WSJ0682:2	The explosion sent shards of metal flying , severing the [DC-10] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's hydraulic or control systems , and led to the crash that killed 112 people .

WSJ0682:3	But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of [Flight 232] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] 's tail engine from a cornfield near the [Sioux City Airport] in [Iowa] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0682:4	The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in [Sioux City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0682:5	Among the issues the board will examine is whether [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks .

WSJ0682:6	The engine involved was a [CF6-6] :[/SUBSTANCE] made by [General Electric Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0682:7	[Anthony Broderick] :[/PERSON] , the [FAA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance , said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as `` hard alpha '' -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago .

WSJ0682:9	The [FAA] :[/ORGANIZATION] already has ordered that all 232 disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and subjected to an ultrasonic test in a water-submersion chamber .

WSJ0682:10	[FAA] :[/ORGANIZATION] confident that a Sioux City-type accident `` wo n't happen again , '' said Mr. [Broderick] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0682:11	A spokesman for [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said that the company has been working with the [FAA] :[/ORGANIZATION] all along on this issue and `` will comply fully with the required inspections . ''

WSJ0682:12	But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's engine production .

WSJ0682:13	The [CF6-6] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] series engines are n't being manufactured any more ; they are only being used in the [DC-10 Series 10] :[/EVENT] planes currently in service , he said .

WSJ0685:0	[CNW Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the final step in the acquisition of the company has been completed with the merger of [CNW] :[/ORGANIZATION] with a subsidiary of Chicago & amp ; North Western Holdings Corp .

WSJ0685:1	As reported , [CNW] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] agreed to be acquired by a group of investors led by [Blackstone Capital Partners Limited Partnership] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 50 a share , or about $ 950 million .

WSJ0481:0	The [New York Times Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it reached a settlement with independent home delivery dealers in the metropolitan [New York] :[/GPE] area that will free the newspaper to expand home delivery circulation .

WSJ0481:1	The settlement stemmed from a lawsuit the dealers filed in 1982 when the [Times] :[/WORK_OF_ART] began its own competing direct delivery service .

WSJ0481:2	The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $ 3.6 million over six years , as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years , based on the number of `` new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures , '' the [Times] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] said .

WSJ0481:4	The settlement , which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the [New York] :[/GPE] area , will allow the [Times] :[/WORK_OF_ART] to freely operate its own direct home delivery system .

WSJ0481:5	Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the [Times] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's 1.1 million daily circulation .

WSJ0484:0	[Giant Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said a federal court in [Delaware] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] has denied a motion by [Rally 's Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] seeking to block a group led by [Giant] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Burt Sugarman] :[/PERSON] from acquiring more of the company 's shares .

WSJ0484:1	[Rally 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a fast-food chain based in [Louisville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ky.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , is contending that Mr. [Sugarman] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and two other company directors failed to disclose to the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] that they intended to acquire a big [Rally] :[/PERSON] stake .

WSJ0484:2	Mr. [Sugarman] :[/PERSON] has in turn contended that the other major shareholder group -- whose interests are represented by three other directors connected to trusts in the name of the children of the company 's founder , [James Patterson] :[/PERSON] -- has ties to a competing fast food chain , [Wendy 's International Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1463:20	For the year , [Winnebago] :[/PRODUCT] had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .

WSJ1474:1	Although major [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , not everyone here is ready to give up .

WSJ1474:2	A handful of small [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s .

WSJ1474:3	With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the [Goliaths] :[/PERSON] of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government .

WSJ1474:4	[Photonics Technology Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Northwood] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick .

WSJ1474:5	[Planar Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Beaverton] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ore.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .

WSJ1474:7	Two other firms , [Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Troy] :[/GPE] , [Mich.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , and [Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh] :[/ORGANIZATION] are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays .

WSJ1474:10	Large [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment .

WSJ1474:11	But except for [Zenith Electronics Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is collaborating with [Toshiba] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .

WSJ1474:12	[General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to [Thompson-CSF] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1474:13	`` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman says .

WSJ1474:14	The small [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized .

WSJ1474:15	`` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says [Zvi Yaniv] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the president of [Ovonic Imaging] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] .

WSJ1474:17	The [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for now .

WSJ1474:18	The only material support it is extending to the struggling [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] industry is $ 30 million in awards from the [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1474:19	The [DARPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] funds are a pittance compared with what [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and other prospective competitors are spending .

WSJ1474:20	The [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion .

WSJ1474:21	`` Unless it gets more help , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] industry wo n't have a chance , '' says [Peter Friedman] :[/PERSON] , [Photonics] :[/PERSON] 's executive vice president .

WSJ1474:22	Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] laboratories .

WSJ1474:23	But [Peter Brody] :[/PERSON] , [Magnascreen] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] innovations in color television and video recording .

WSJ1474:24	In the 1970s , Mr. [Brody] :[/PERSON] helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at [Westinghouse Electric Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's research labs in [Pittsburgh] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1474:26	In 1979 , however , [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION] abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television .

WSJ1474:27	Mr. [Brody] :[/PERSON] left the company to find other backers .

WSJ1474:28	He has a claim to the right to commercialize the [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION] patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers .

WSJ1474:29	`` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. [Brody] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1474:31	Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the [Pentagon] :[/FACILITY] justifies its help on national-security grounds .

WSJ1474:32	`` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our { HDTV } requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says [Michael Kelly] :[/PERSON] , director of [DARPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's defense manufacturing office .

WSJ1474:33	So [DARPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds .

WSJ1474:35	The [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is ordering displays for its [Aegis] :[/ORGANIZATION] cruisers and the [Army] :[/ORGANIZATION] wants smaller versions for its [Abrams] :[/PERSON] battle tanks .

WSJ1474:36	The [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .

WSJ1474:37	`` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues [Jack Clifford] :[/PERSON] , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation .

WSJ1474:39	Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more [DARPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] funds .

WSJ1474:41	They also want [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] trade policy to reflect the [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Commerce] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] department 's concern over their future .

WSJ1474:42	They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including [Matsushita] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Hitachi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Toshiba] :[/ORGANIZATION] , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs .

WSJ1474:43	And they want the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to help them sell overseas .

WSJ1474:44	[Planar] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] President [James Hurd] :[/PERSON] says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , while panels from those countries enter the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] duty-free .

WSJ0001:0	[Pierre Vinken] :[/PERSON] , 61 years old , will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29 .

WSJ0001:1	Mr. [Vinken] :[/PERSON] is chairman of [Elsevier N.V.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the Dutch publishing group .

WSJ0004:1	The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by [IBC] :[/PERSON] 's [Money Fund Report] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .

WSJ0004:3	Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to [Donoghue 's] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0004:7	Nevertheless , said [Brenda Malizia Negus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , editor of [Money Fund Report] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short-term interest rates .

WSJ0004:8	The yield on six-month [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .

WSJ0005:0	[J.P. Bolduc] :[/ORGANIZATION] , vice chairman of W.R. Grace & amp ; Co. , which holds a 83.4 % interest in this energy-services company , was elected a director .

WSJ0005:1	He succeeds [Terrence D. Daniels] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , formerly a [W.R. Grace] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] vice chairman , who resigned .

WSJ0005:2	[W.R. Grace] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] holds three of [Grace Energy] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's seven board seats .

WSJ0008:0	The federal government suspended sales of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] savings bonds because [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .

WSJ0008:1	Until [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0008:4	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION] has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 3.1 trillion , but the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .

WSJ0008:5	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] will default on Nov. 9 if [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] does n't act by then .

WSJ0010:0	When it 's time for their biannual powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like [Boca Raton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Hot Springs] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0010:2	The [National Association of Manufacturers] :[/ORGANIZATION] settled on the Hoosier capital of [Indianapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] for its fall board meeting .

WSJ0010:4	The idea , of course : to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the [Rust Belt] :[/PERSON] is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .

WSJ0010:5	On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like [Du Pont] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Maytag] :[/EVENT] , along with lesser knowns like [Trojan Steel] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Valley Queen Cheese Factory] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ0010:6	For starters , the executives joined Mayor [William H. Hudnut III] :[/PERSON] for an evening of the [Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra] :[/ORGANIZATION] and a guest pianist-comedian [Victor Borge] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0010:7	[Champagne] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [dessert] :[/SUBSTANCE] followed .

WSJ0010:8	The next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the [Indianapolis Motor Speedway] , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .

WSJ0010:10	A buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where [food] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [drinks] :[/SUBSTANCE] are banned to everyday visitors .

WSJ0010:11	Then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out four drivers , crews and even the official [Indianapolis 500] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] announcer for a 10-lap exhibition [race] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ0010:12	After the [race] :[/PRODUCT] , Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .

WSJ0010:16	Under the stars and moons of the renovated [Indiana Roof ballroom] , nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them [Indiana] :[/LOCATION] duckling [mousseline] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , lobster [consomme] :[/PERSON] , veal [mignon] :[/SUBSTANCE] and chocolate [terrine] :[/SUBSTANCE] with a raspberry [sauce] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0010:19	But for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- [Boca] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in February .

WSJ0017:0	[Texas Instruments Japan Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Texas Instruments Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said it opened a plant in [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to manufacture control devices .

WSJ0017:1	The new plant , located in [Chinchon] :[/GPE] about 60 miles from [Seoul] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in [South Korea] :[/GPE] , the company said .

WSJ2256:0	THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of [Black Monday] :[/EVENT] as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .

WSJ2256:1	The [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] industrials closed up 88.12 points , at 2657.38 , the fourth-biggest gain ever , after being down as much as 63.52 points in the morning .

WSJ2256:9	[AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slid $ 22.125 , to $ 76.50 .

WSJ2256:10	Also , a [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] group tried to get financing for a lower bid , possibly $ 250 a share .

WSJ2256:13	[IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's earnings tumbled 30 % in the third quarter , slightly more than expected .

WSJ2270:1	[Maxus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it did n't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field , which is about 1.6 miles from the [Intan Field] :[/FACILITY] , because the wells are similar to others drilled at its [Intan] :[/LOCATION] and [Widuri] :[/GPE] fields .

WSJ2270:2	However , [Maxus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1140:1	The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled Oct. 13 , the day the [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite index slid 3 % and the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] tumbled 7 % .

WSJ1140:3	As it happens , the [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge .

WSJ1140:4	However , the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the [National Association of Securities Dealers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] include only those trades completed , or settled , by Oct. 13 , rather than trades that occurred on that day , according to [Gene Finn] :[/PERSON] , chief economist for the [NASD] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1142:8	[MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION] traded as low as 41 during the session .

WSJ1142:9	Other active stocks included [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose American depositary receipts added 1\/8 to 11 .

WSJ1142:10	[Apple Computer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] improved 7\/8 to 47 ; [Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slipped 1\/4 to 33 , and [Valley National Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was up 1\/8 to 15 .

WSJ1142:11	`` The market started with several strikes against it , '' said [Peter DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] , head of retail equity trading at [Shearson Lehman Hutton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] continued to unravel , and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating .

WSJ1142:12	But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market , Mr. [DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1142:13	Even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes , he said , `` when the market does recover , the damage is done and it leaves [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] down more than the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ1142:14	Mr. [DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors .

WSJ1142:15	While [Shearson] :[/ORGANIZATION] does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account , the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes , Mr. [DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] acknowledged .

WSJ1142:24	[Groused Robert Antolini] :[/PERSON] , head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson , Lufkin & amp ; Jenrette : `` It 's making it tough for traders to make money . ''

WSJ1142:27	[Lodestar Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it will make a $ 6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock if it acquires a majority of the company 's shares in a pending rights offering by [Kinder-Care Learning Center] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/GPE,/GPE/CITY,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/PRODUCT,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] 's parent , [Kinder-Care Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1142:28	Shares of [KinderCare Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed at 3 , also up 1\/4 , on volume of 700,000 .

WSJ1142:29	[Ohio Casualty] :[/ORGANIZATION] dropped 2 to 49 .

WSJ1142:31	The company estimated that losses from [Hurricane Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter .

WSJ1142:32	The company said losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] have n't yet been determined , but that it provides earthquake coverage to about 1,400 properties in the stricken area .

WSJ1142:34	[North Atlantic Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] jumped 1 to 5 .

WSJ1142:35	The electronics-instruments maker is to be acquired by [Asset Management Associates] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 7.25 a share .

WSJ1142:36	[LIN Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slid 1 to 108 , despite reporting third-quarter net of 46 cents a share , up from 39 cents the previous year .

WSJ1142:37	The company said the latest quarter included about $ 3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to [McCaw Cellular Communications '] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bid for the company and [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's merger pact with [BellSouth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1142:38	[McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was unchanged at 40 .

WSJ1142:39	[XL\/Datacomp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slid 2 to 16 amid continuing concerns about the company 's contract negotiations with [International Business Machines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1142:40	[IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is reviewing its entire business-partners program , and [XL\/Datacomp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] confirmed earlier this month that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current IBM-remarketer contract .

WSJ1142:41	Remarketers make modifications to [IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's computer hardware and resell the products .

WSJ1142:42	[Omni Capital Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] surged 1 to 16 .

WSJ1143:0	Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation , for example , is the [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] radar .

WSJ1143:1	-- `` [Arms Control Reality] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' Nov. 20 , 1984 , the first of some 20 [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] editorials saying that [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] violated the [ABM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] treaty .

WSJ1143:3	`` Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the [ABM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] treaty at this time . ''

WSJ1143:4	The delegation included a reporter from the [New York Times] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , aides to Sen. [Edward M. Kennedy] :[/PERSON] and Rep. [Les AuCoin] :[/PERSON] , and [Natural Resources Defense Council] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] staff members .

WSJ1143:5	-- The [Washington Post] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , Sept. 9 , 1987 .

WSJ1143:6	-- The [U.S.S.R.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness , by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] radar as well as radar vans in the areas of [Gomel] :[/PERSON] and [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the [ABM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] treaty of 1972 on the part of the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1143:7	-- Letter from [Eduard Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] to [U.N.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary-General [Perez de Cuellar] :[/PERSON] , reported in [Tass] :[/PERSON] , June 10 , 1988 .

WSJ1143:8	-- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted , I say it directly , a clear violation of [ABM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1143:9	-- [Eduard Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] , Oct. 23 , 1989 .

WSJ1143:10	We 're happy , we guess , to receive confirmation of the [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] violation from the Soviets , five years after we started writing about it .

WSJ1143:12	Without question , something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the [Politburo] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1143:17	[Sverdlovsk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1143:18	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there , and hence a violation of the 1972 [Biological Weapons Convention] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1143:19	The [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's recently issued `` [Soviet Military Power] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' though in general adopting a softer line , repeated the [Sverdlovsk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] assessment .

WSJ1143:20	It also was detailed in [Congressional] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] testimony this past February : An explosion at the [Microbiology and Virology Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Sverdlovsk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths .

WSJ1143:21	Since Mr. [Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] did not address this topic before the [Supreme Soviet] :[/GPE] , the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted [meat] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1143:22	We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. [Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] 's assurance last year that [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] did n't violate the [ABM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] treaty .

WSJ1143:23	And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] , we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] last year .

WSJ1143:24	The Soviets ' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal [feed] :[/SUBSTANCE] made from the bones of [cattle] :[/PLANT] that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with [anthrax] :[/SUBSTANCE] spores .

WSJ1143:25	[Harvard] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Matthew Meselson] :[/PERSON] -- who we read has sold something called the `` scientific community '' on the notion that `` yellow [rain] :[/SUBSTANCE] '' attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant [bees] :[/SUBSTANCE] -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario `` completely plausible . ''

WSJ1143:27	And we certainly do not believe that Mr. [Gorbachev] :[/PERSON] or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it .

WSJ1143:28	[Sverdlovsk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself .

WSJ1143:29	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] government 's [Sverdlovsk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] complaint , as with [Krasnoyarsk] :[/GPE] , is no mere political posturing .

WSJ1143:30	Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate , and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] government .

WSJ1143:31	But the stated [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] position is detailed and specific , and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling .

WSJ1143:32	The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that [Sverdlovsk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] violated the 1972 agreement or , alternatively , that would give [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident .

WSJ1143:33	Until that happens , glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. [Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] was bidding for with his confessions on Monday .

WSJ1145:0	[Northeast Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION] raised its bid for [Public Service Co. of New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , which is operating under [Bankruptcy Code] :[/ORGANIZATION] protection , to $ 2.25 billion from $ 1.85 billion .

WSJ1145:1	[Northeast] :[/LOCATION] 's raised bid , which was supported by [PS of New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's official shareholder committee , is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company , the largest utility in [New Hampshire] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1145:2	The $ 2.25 billion value claimed by [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] , based in [Hartford] :[/GPE] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , is the highest yet given to a bid .

WSJ1145:5	Under the new [Northeast Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plan , it would pay $ 1.65 billion in cash to creditors and assume $ 100 million in pollution control bonds .

WSJ1145:6	Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest , while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before [PS of New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] filed for [Bankruptcy Code] :[/ORGANIZATION] protection in January

WSJ1145:7	The biggest change in [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short shrift previously .

WSJ1145:8	Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant , which is completed but is n't yet operating , equity holders would receive up to $ 500 million in cash , preferred stock and new 10-year [Seabrook] bonds .

WSJ1145:9	[Northeast] :[/LOCATION] 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ 165 million .

WSJ1145:10	In addition , [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] promised the [State of New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] that rate increases would be limited to 5.5 % annually for seven years .

WSJ1145:11	Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on [Seabrook] operations and other contingencies .

WSJ1145:12	[Wilbur Ross] :[/PERSON] , financial adviser to the equity holders said , `` Given the state 's strong bargaining position ... we believe the [NU] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plan provides the best recovery available '' to [PS of New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's equity holders .

WSJ1145:13	Officials of [PS of New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] could n't be reached for comment .

WSJ1145:16	[New England Electric System] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Westborough] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , has proposed buying the company for $ 2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8 % annually for seven years .

WSJ1145:17	The state of [New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] has favored that plan .

WSJ1145:18	The other bidder is [United Illuminating Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New Haven] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , with a bid valued at $ 2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5 % rate increases .

WSJ0117:0	The [United Kingdom High Court] :[/ORGANIZATION] declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] borough council and commercial banks .

WSJ0117:1	The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .

WSJ0117:2	As many as 70 [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities .

WSJ0117:7	At one point , [Hammersmith] :[/WORK_OF_ART] is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .

WSJ0117:12	The court hearing began in early October at the request of [Anthony Hazell] :[/PERSON] , district auditor for [Hammersmith] :[/PLANT] , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities .

WSJ0117:14	Although the [Hammersmith and Fulham] :[/PERSON] council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital-markets transactions , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .

WSJ0117:15	`` While this court ruling was only on [Hammersmith] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' a solicitor representing one of the banks said .

WSJ0117:17	Other financial institutions involved include [Barclays Bank PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Midland Bank PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Security Pacific Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Chemical Banking Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Chemical Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Citibank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Mitsubishi Finance International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0118:2	Their own employer , [Kidder Peabody] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0118:8	On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] futures exchanges .

WSJ0118:10	Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .

WSJ0118:12	The [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a major futures marketplace , yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , and the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading .

WSJ0118:14	.

WSJ0118:16	''

WSJ0118:17	Big Board stock specialists , in a bold palace revolt , began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the [Big Board] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT] to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading .

WSJ0118:18	[Charles Wohlstetter] :[/PERSON] , the chairman of [Contel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause , says he has received `` countless '' letters offering support .

WSJ0118:26	Last week , [Robert M. Bradley] :[/PERSON] , one of the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered .

WSJ0118:27	He sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman [John J. Phelan Jr.] :[/PERSON] in which he said the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] is too focused on machines , rather than people .

WSJ0118:29	`` I do not want my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino , '' Mr. [Bradley] :[/PERSON] wrote .

WSJ0118:31	At [Kidder] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away .

WSJ0118:32	Corporations like Contel denounce program trading , yet [Contel] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] has in the past hired pension fund managers like [Bankers Trust Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] that are also big program traders .

WSJ0118:33	The [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- the nation 's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives .

WSJ0118:35	But the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's leadership -- over the specialists ' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program trading .

WSJ0118:36	`` A lot of people would like to go back to 1970 , '' before program trading , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said this week .

WSJ0118:41	`` The public did n't come to the market to play a game ; they can go to [Off-Track Betting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for that , '' says [A. Brean Murray] :[/LOCATION] , chairman of [Brean Murray , Foster Securities] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] , a traditional money management firm .

WSJ0118:43	Critics like Mr. [Murray] :[/LOCATION] `` are looking for witches , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , '' says [J. Thomas Allen] :[/PERSON] , president of [Advanced Investment Management Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Pittsburgh] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage .

WSJ0118:46	Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] futures markets .

WSJ0118:53	[Larry Zicklin] :[/PERSON] , managing partner at Neuberger & amp ; Berman .

WSJ0118:55	`` I have not seen one iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a [Vanderbilt University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] finance professor , [Hans Stoll] :[/PERSON] , an authority on the subject .

WSJ0118:56	Says the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] , `` Volatility is greater than program trading . ''

WSJ0118:57	The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders , but by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of [UAL Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0118:58	Unable to unload [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock they had .

WSJ0118:59	While program trades swiftly kicked in , a `` circuit breaker '' that halted trading in stock futures in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] made some program trading impossible .

WSJ0118:60	[Susan Del Signore] :[/PERSON] , head trader at [Travelers Investment Management Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , says critics are ignoring `` the role the { takeover stock } speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility . ''

WSJ0118:65	P

WSJ0118:69	The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] stock-specialist firms .

WSJ0118:72	And they believe the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] , under Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] , has abandoned their interest .

WSJ0118:73	The son of a specialist and once one himself , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets .

WSJ0118:75	`` When the sell programs hit , you can hear the order printers start to go '' on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] trading floor , says one specialist there .

WSJ0118:79	`` Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death , '' says [Raymond A. Mason] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , chairman of regional broker [Legg Mason Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Baltimore] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0118:83	Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S & amp ; P 500 often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do , complains [Andrew Sigler] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Champion International Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0118:85	Oh , you 're in the paper business , '' is one reaction Mr. [Sigler] :[/PERSON] says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders .

WSJ0118:86	By this September , program traders were doing a record 13.8 % of the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's average daily trading volume .

WSJ0118:87	[Kidder Peabody] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Salomon Brothers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [PaineWebber Group Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0118:93	For example , stock-index futures began trading in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched .

WSJ0118:95	Now , on a good day , [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] trades in stock .

WSJ0118:97	The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0118:98	Program traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says Rep. [Edward Markey] :[/PERSON] , a [Massachusetts] :[/GPE] Democrat .

WSJ0118:104	Many people , including the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] , think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle .

WSJ0118:105	The Big Board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered , [Big Board] :[/GPE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LOCATION,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/GPE/CITY,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN] officials say .

WSJ0118:106	`` You 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks , '' says [Vanderbilt] :[/PERSON] 's Prof. [Stoll] :[/PERSON] . ``

WSJ0118:111	Program trading critics also want the [Federal Reserve Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins .

WSJ0118:114	Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the [Great Crash of 1929] :[/EVENT] that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers .

WSJ0118:115	The [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .

WSJ0118:121	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [John Phelan] :[/PERSON] said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings .

WSJ0118:125	In index arbitrage , the widget is the S & amp ; P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and the stock markets largely in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0118:126	To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S & amp ; P 500 widget in [New York] :[/GPE] must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S & amp ; P 500 widget in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0118:134	The [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares .

WSJ0118:139	An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in [New York] :[/GPE] and [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to cover all transaction costs .

WSJ0118:141	Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S & amp ; P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0118:143	Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to [New York] :[/GPE] , while functioning as a buyer in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0118:145	Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] instead of [New York] :[/GPE] ?

WSJ0118:155	Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! '' The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .

WSJ0118:183	Mr. [Allen] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Pittsburgh] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] firm , [Advanced Investment Management Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , executes program trades for institutions .

WSJ0119:0	Some Democrats in [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years .

WSJ0119:1	The funding mechanism , which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President [Bush] :[/PERSON] , would affect the antitrust operations of the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Federal Trade Commission] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0119:2	As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending , [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] cut by $ 30 million the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 .

WSJ0119:3	To offset the reduction , [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .

WSJ0119:4	Some Democrats , led by Rep. [Jack Brooks] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .

WSJ0119:5	But [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [FTC] :[/PERSON] officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .

WSJ0119:6	`` It could operate to augment our budget , '' [James Rill] :[/PERSON] , the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's antitrust chief , said in an interview .

WSJ0119:7	Under measures approved by both houses of [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the [Antitrust Division] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would be cut $ 15 million .

WSJ0119:8	The [FTC] :[/PERSON] budget request of $ 70 million , about $ 34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement , would also be cut by $ 15 million .

WSJ0119:10	The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the [Hart-Scott-Rodino Act] :[/LAW] .

WSJ0119:11	Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify [FTC] :[/PERSON] and [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .

WSJ0119:14	`` When you do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the [FTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , Rep. [Neal Smith] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Iowa] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) said during [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] debate .

WSJ0119:15	But Rep. [Don Edwards] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Calif] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] . ) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected .

WSJ0119:16	The antitrust staffs of both the [FTC] :[/PERSON] and [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] were cut more than 40 % in the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .

WSJ0119:17	`` Today is not the time to signal that [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen , '' Mr. [Edwards] :[/PERSON] argued .

WSJ0119:18	Any money in excess of $ 40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] at large .

WSJ0121:0	Program trading is `` a racket , '' complains [Edward Egnuss] :[/PERSON] , a [White Plains] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.Y.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , investor and electronics sales executive , `` and it 's not to the benefit of the small investor , that 's for sure . ''

WSJ0121:2	Mr. [Egnuss] :[/PERSON] 's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by [Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] reporters across the country .

WSJ0121:3	But like Mr. [Egnuss] :[/PERSON] , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be .

WSJ0121:4	`` I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , '' says [Leo Fields] :[/PERSON] , a [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] investor .

WSJ0121:9	Or , as [Dorothy Arighi] :[/PERSON] , an interior decorator in [Arnold] :[/PERSON] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , puts it : `` All kinds of funny things spook the market these days . ''

WSJ0121:13	[Atlanta] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Buckhead] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading .

WSJ0121:14	Citing the October 1987 crash , [Glenn Miller] :[/PERSON] says , `` It 's like the last crash -- they threatened , but no one did anything . ''

WSJ0121:15	[A. Donald Anderson] :[/PERSON] , a 59-year-old [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] investor who says the stock market 's `` fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie-jeebies , '' does n't see much point in outlawing program trading .

WSJ0121:17	Similarly , [Rick Wamre] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a 31-year-old asset manager for a [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] real-estate firm , would like to see program trading disappear because `` I ca n't see that it does anything for the market or the country . ''

WSJ0121:21	[Peter Anthony] :[/PERSON] , who runs an employment agency in [New York] :[/GPE] , decries program trading as `` limiting the game to a few , '' but he also is n't sure it should be more strictly regulated .

WSJ0121:24	[Glenn Britta] :[/PERSON] , a 25-year-old [New York] :[/GPE] financial analyst who plays options for his personal account , says he is `` factoring '' the market 's volatility `` into investment decisions . ''

WSJ0121:28	Also in [New York] :[/GPE] , [Israel Silverman] :[/GPE] , an insurance-company lawyer , comments that program trading `` increases volatility , but I do n't think it should be banned .

WSJ0121:35	[Jim Enzor] :[/PERSON] of [Atlanta] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge .

WSJ0121:39	[Scott Taccetta] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] accountant , is going into money-market funds .

WSJ0121:40	Mr. [Taccetta] :[/PERSON] says he had just recouped the $ 5,000 he lost in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 .

WSJ0121:42	In October , before the market dropped , Mrs. [Arighi] :[/PERSON] of [Arnold] :[/PERSON] , [Calif.] :[/GPE] , moved to sell the `` speculative stocks '' in her family trust `` so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery '' caused by program trading .

WSJ0121:44	[Lucille Gorman] :[/PERSON] , an 84-year-old [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] housewife , has become amazingly immune to stock-market jolts .

WSJ0121:45	Mrs. [Gorman] :[/PERSON] took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge .

WSJ0124:0	[William C. Walbrecher Jr.] :[/PERSON] , an executive at San Francisco-based [1st Nationwide Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was named president and chief executive officer of [Citadel Holding Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and its principal operating unit , [Fidelity Federal Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0124:2	He succeeds [James A. Taylor] :[/PERSON] , who stepped down as chairman , president and chief executive in March for health reasons .

WSJ0124:3	[Edward L. Kane] :[/PERSON] succeeded Mr. [Taylor] :[/PERSON] as chairman .

WSJ0124:4	Separately , [Citadel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a third-quarter net loss of $ 2.3 million , or 68 cents a share , versus net income of $ 5.3 million , or $ 1.61 a share , a year earlier .

WSJ0124:6	Those included costs associated with the potential [Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] acquisition , which was terminated on Sept. 27 , 1989 .

WSJ0124:8	In [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [Citadel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares closed yesterday at $ 45.75 , down 25 cents .

WSJ1479:0	[Arizona Instrument Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $ 600,000 , or 25 cents to 27 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 214,000 , or 10 cents a share , a year earlier .

WSJ1479:1	The [Tempe] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , maker of underground fuel-storage systems said the most recent period was affected by customers ' problems complying with recent [Environmental Protection Agency] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] regulations .

WSJ1483:0	[MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it filed a shelf registration with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] for issuance of as much as $ 750 million of debt securities .

WSJ1483:1	[Merrill Lynch Capital Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ; [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ; Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co. and [Salomon Brothers Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1483:2	The funds will be used for refinancing existing debt of the [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [D.C.] :[/LOCATION] , concern at lower interest rates and for other general purposes .

WSJ1483:3	The effective date of the registration is to be determined by the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1489:0	[Comair Holdings Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said in [Cincinnati] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] that it bought [Airline Aviation Academy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a pilot training school based at [Sanford Regional Airport] near [Orlando] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Fla] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1489:1	[Comair] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it paid cash but declined to disclose the price .

WSJ1489:2	[Comair Holdings] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is the parent of [Comair Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a regional air carrier .

WSJ1489:3	[Airline Aviation] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has annual revenue of $ 5 million to $ 6 million , has great growth potential because of the large number of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] pilots nearing retirement age , [Comair] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1489:4	The unit will be renamed [Comair Aviation Academy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and will continue to be headed by [Scott Williams] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a son of its founder , [Comair] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0175:0	[Sony Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] completed its tender offer for [Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , with [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shareholders tendering 99.3 % of all common shares outstanding by the Tuesday deadline .

WSJ0175:1	[Sony Columbia Acquisition Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , formed for the [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] deal , will formally take ownership of the movie studio later this month , a spokesman said .

WSJ0175:2	[Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is paying $ 27 a share , or $ 3.55 billion , cash and is assuming $ 1.4 billion of long-term debt .

WSJ0175:3	Still unresolved is [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's effort to hire producers [Jon Peters] :[/PERSON] and [Peter Guber] :[/PERSON] to run the studio .

WSJ0175:4	[Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's planned acquisition of [Guber\/Peters Entertainment Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 200 million is scheduled to close Monday .

WSJ0175:5	[Guber\/Peters] :[/PERSON] has been locked in litigation with [Warner Communications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in an attempt to get out of an exclusive production contract with [Warner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0179:0	Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] investigation , a [Drexel Burnham Lambert] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor .

WSJ0179:1	[Thomas Spiegel] :[/PERSON,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , who built the $ 12.7 billion [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , thrift with high-yield junk bonds .

WSJ0179:2	Bears have targeted [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market .

WSJ0179:3	And some investors fault Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's jet planes .

WSJ0179:4	[Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stock recently hit 4 , after reaching 11 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] would take the thrift private .

WSJ0179:5	Moreover , junk professionals think [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough , meaning another markdown could be coming .

WSJ0179:6	But in recent days , [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has edged up , closing at 5 , up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure .

WSJ0179:7	Mr. [Spiegel] :[/PERSON] 's fans say [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Southern California] :[/GPE] branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .

WSJ0179:8	That 's almost $ 10 of equity for each [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion .

WSJ0179:9	[Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has only about 10 million common shares in public hands .

WSJ0179:10	The [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .

WSJ0179:11	Other big common holders are [Carl Lindner] :[/PERSON] 's [American Financial] :[/ORGANIZATION] , investor [Irwin Jacobs] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Pacific Financial Research] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , though the latter cut its stake this summer .

WSJ0179:12	While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] is mulling such a plan to mitigate [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's junk problems .

WSJ0179:13	Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold [Columbia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .

WSJ0179:14	[Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wo n't comment on all the speculation .

WSJ0179:18	That 's why [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .

WSJ0179:19	But if [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right .

WSJ0179:20	[Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a longtime [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] client , wo n't provide current data on its junk .

WSJ0179:22	These were [Allied Stores] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Western Union Telegraph] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Gillett Holdings] :[/PERSON] , [SCI Television] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Texas Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] , though many other bonds in [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's portfolio also have lost value .

WSJ0179:23	Possibly offsetting that , [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .

WSJ0179:25	One trial balloon Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] is said to have floated to investors : [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] might be broken up , as [Mellon Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was split into a good bank and a bad bank .

WSJ0179:26	But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of [Columbia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .

WSJ0179:27	Some think [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] presence .

WSJ0179:29	Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off to [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shareholders , including Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , who might then have a new career , investors say .

WSJ0179:30	It is n't clear how much a restructuring would help [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stockholders .

WSJ0179:32	You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist [Lewis Ranieri] :[/PERSON] of [Ranieri Associates] :[/PERSON] in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0179:33	Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street .

WSJ0179:34	Few people think Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to become .

WSJ0179:35	`` They are n't really a thrift , '' says [Jonathan Gray] :[/PERSON] , a [Sanford C. Bernstein] :[/PERSON] analyst .

WSJ0179:36	Of course , regulators would have to approve [Columbia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's reorganization .

WSJ0179:37	And some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't feasible while the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] still is scrutinizing Mr. [Spiegel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's past junk-bond trades .

WSJ0179:39	Columbia Savings & amp ; Loan ( [NYSE] :[/ORGANIZATION] ; Symbol : CSV )

WSJ0194:0	[USX Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .

WSJ0194:3	In the 1988 period , [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement .

WSJ0194:6	However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .

WSJ0194:8	[Peter Marcus] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with [PaineWebber Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] results .

WSJ0194:9	Moreover , [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .

WSJ0194:10	The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the [Lorain] :[/GPE] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Kobe Steel Ltd .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0194:12	Profit per ton of [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said .

WSJ0194:13	Still , [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] shipped than either [Bethlehem Steel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or [Inland Steel Industries Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose profit plummeted 70 % .

WSJ0194:14	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday , [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales .

WSJ0194:15	The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .

WSJ0194:16	[Charles Bradford] :[/GPE] , an analyst with [Merrill Lynch Capital Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year .

WSJ0194:17	He said [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .

WSJ0194:19	Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the [Marathon Oil Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .

WSJ0194:20	.

WSJ0194:21	[USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell [TXO] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's oil and gas reserves .

WSJ0194:24	[USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .

WSJ0194:25	The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor [Carl Icahn] :[/PERSON] had increased his stake in [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination .

WSJ0194:26	Mr. [Icahn] :[/ORGANIZATION] has said he believes [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .

WSJ1750:0	[HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans .

WSJ1750:1	HealthVest , an [Austin] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , real estate investment trust , said that [Chemical Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement , told it that if $ 3.3 million owed to the bank group is n't paid by today , the group will call the $ 120 million that [HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has outstanding under the credit line .

WSJ1750:3	[HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] missed a payment to the group that was due in late September .

WSJ1750:4	In addition , [HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said [Bank of Tokyo Trust Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default .

WSJ1750:5	[HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] missed an interest payment to [Bank of Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on Oct. 1 .

WSJ1750:6	However , HealthVest said the [Tokyo] :[/GPE] bank indicated that it wo n't accelerate [HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 50 million loan .

WSJ1750:7	[HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate , [Healthcare International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , has failed to make about $ 10.6 million in principal and interest payments owed since August .

WSJ1750:8	[Healthcare] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] operates many of the health-care properties that [HealthVest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] owns .

WSJ1753:0	A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] of natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] from big , untapped fields in the [Mackenzie River delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] area of the western [Canadian Arctic] :[/FACILITY] .

WSJ1753:1	Three companies , [Esso Resources Canada Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Shell Canada Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , applied to the [Canadian National Energy Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of [Mackenzie delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] over 20 years starting in 1996 .

WSJ1753:3	It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1753:4	The board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the [Mackenzie delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] on terms similar to those offered to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] customers .

WSJ1753:5	[U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] buyers have already been lined up .

WSJ1753:6	They include [Enron Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Texas Eastern Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Pacific Interstate Transmission Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1753:7	The project could result in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] taking more than 10 % of its natural gas supplies from [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , up from about 5 % currently .

WSJ1753:9	The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the [Mackenzie delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to [Alberta] :[/LOCATION] would be about C $ 5.9 million .

WSJ1753:10	It also said projections of surging [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] demand for natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] and price forecasts of C $ 5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable .

WSJ1753:11	[Esso] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Imperial Oil Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] which is 71 % - owned by [Exxon Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in the 20-year period .

WSJ1753:12	[Shell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a subsidiary of [Royal Dutch\/Shell Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet , and [Gulf] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of Olympia & amp ; York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet .

WSJ1755:3	That rose to nearly 18 % during the [Depression] :[/EVENT] , and has n't changed much since .

WSJ1755:10	`` There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth , '' says [Edward N. Wolff] :[/PERSON] , professor of economics at [New York University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1756:0	[McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it sent a letter to [LIN Broadcasting Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] clarifying its revised tender offer for LIN and asking [LIN] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] to conduct `` a fair auction . ''

WSJ1756:1	The letter apparently came in response to a request for clarification by [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] earlier this week .

WSJ1756:2	[LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which has agreed with [BellSouth Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to merge their cellular-telephone businesses , said then that it would n't take a position on [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's revised tender offer .

WSJ1756:3	Earlier this month , [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] revised its offer to $ 125 a share for 22 million [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares .

WSJ1756:4	McCaw is seeking 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern ; the revised offer includes a feature requiring [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/PRODUCT/WEAPON] to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1756:6	In a statement , [Craig O. McCaw] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer of [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said : `` We trust [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] will take no further actions that favor [BellSouth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ1756:7	[McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board .

WSJ1756:9	LIN would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] cellular interests in markets other than those in which [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] holds an interest , or which are contiguous to those markets , unless [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has an interest there or contiguous to it .

WSJ1756:10	Independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's best interest .

WSJ1756:11	Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] at the time it is to be sold in five years .

WSJ1756:12	If [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] is put up for sale rather than purchased by McCaw in five years , [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/GPE,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/CITY,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION] wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it , and the independent directors will run the bidding .

WSJ1756:13	The directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional [Bell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] operating companies to purchase the company 's interests .

WSJ1757:0	[MCA Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said third-quarter net fell 6.3 % to $ 50.8 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 54.3 million , or 74 cents a share , a year earlier .

WSJ1757:1	[MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said revenue rose 14 % to $ 918.4 million from $ 806.7 million .

WSJ1757:2	The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter , including `` [Parenthood] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' and `` [Uncle Buck] :[/GPE] , '' contributed to record revenue for its film unit .

WSJ1757:3	Both [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's music-entertainment and book-publishing units also posted record revenue and operating profit .

WSJ1757:4	The parent company 's net included a loss -- which it did n't specify -- that was related to the company 's 50 % stake in [Cineplex Odeon Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1757:5	[Cineplex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] theater chain , had a second-quarter net loss of $ 38.7 million .

WSJ1757:6	[MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its [LJN Toys] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' international operations .

WSJ1757:7	These items were partly offset , [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said , by an unspecified gain on the sale of its [Miller International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes .

WSJ1757:8	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rose $ 1.50 to $ 64 .

Shipley] :[/PERSON] , 53 , chairman and chief executive officer of [Chemical Banking Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1765:0	[BankAmerica Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a 34 % jump in third-quarter earnings , as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans , higher interest margins and negligible loan losses .

WSJ1765:1	For the quarter , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it earned $ 254 million , or $ 1.16 a share , compared with $ 190 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .

WSJ1765:2	[BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake .

WSJ1765:5	For the first time in nearly two years , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] results failed to improve in consecutive quarters , but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors .

WSJ1765:10	Moreover , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ 170 million , about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ 100 million in the year-earlier quarter .

WSJ1765:11	The provision rate was far above [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's actual net credit losses of $ 24 million in the third quarter , compared with $ 18 million in the second period and $ 38 million a year earlier .

WSJ1765:12	As a result , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans , once below 25 % , now amounts to 45 % of the $ 6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations .

WSJ1765:13	[Bankers Trust New York Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and J.P. Morgan & amp ; Co. , respectively .

WSJ1765:15	[BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor , [Security Pacific Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which posted a 0.89 % return in the third quarter .

WSJ1765:16	[San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] neighbor , Wells Fargo & amp ; Co. , which reported an extraordinary 1.25 % return on assets .

WSJ1765:18	`` They { [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] } continue to show good performance , '' said [Donald K. Crowley] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Keefe , Bruyette & amp ; Woods Inc. , [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1765:19	In composite trading yesterday on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at $ 32 a share .

WSJ1765:23	[BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's total loans rose 8 % to $ 71.36 billion .

WSJ1765:24	For the nine months , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] profit soared 81 % to $ 833 million , or $ 4.07 a share , from $ 461 million , or $ 2.40 a share .

WSJ1769:0	[Golden Nugget Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 13.1 million , or 76 cents a share , based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding .

WSJ1769:4	Most of the expenses stem from the company 's huge [Mirage] :[/LANGUAGE] resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the [Strip] , and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown [Golden Nugget] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] property .

WSJ1769:5	For the nine months , [Golden Nugget] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a net loss of $ 11.4 million , or 69 cents a share , based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding .

WSJ1769:10	[John Uphoff] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Raymond James & amp ; Associates , said the results were n't surprising , and attributed the buy-back to management 's confidence in the [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990 .

WSJ1769:11	Yesterday , in [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [Golden Nugget] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common closed at $ 28.25 , up $ 2 .

WSJ1243:0	[France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's industrial production index for July and August rose 1 % from June and was up 4.6 % from a year ago , according to seasonally adjusted data from the [National Statistics Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0950:0	[General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's big defense and automotive electronics unit , [GM Hughes Electronics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said net income fell 22 % in the third quarter , reflecting declining military spending and slumping [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] vehicle production .

WSJ0950:1	Meanwhile , net at [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's finance arm , [General Motors Acceptance Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , fell 3.1 % .

WSJ0950:2	By contrast , [Electronic Data Systems Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's data processing subsidiary , boosted net 16 % .

WSJ0950:3	[GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed down $ 1.875 at $ 44.875 in [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] trading yesterday .

WSJ0950:4	Earnings for GM common stock , reflecting the performance of [GM] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's core automotive operations , will be disclosed this morning .

WSJ0950:5	[GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Class H , which represents a dividend interest in [Hughes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] earnings , closed at $ 29 , up 25 cents in [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading .

WSJ0950:6	[GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Class E , which represents a dividend interest in [EDS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] profit , fell 75 cents to $ 52.25 on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0950:7	The earnings drop at [GM Hughes Electronics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of [Hughes Aircraft Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and GM 's North American automotive operations , which are a primary customer for the [Delco Electronics Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] side of the [GM Hughes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Hughes unit .

WSJ0950:8	Profit at the unit fell to $ 110.6 million , or 37 cents a share , from $ 142.4 million , or 45 cents a share , largely because of a $ 24 million one-time charge associated with [Hughes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end .

WSJ0950:10	In addition , [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's North American vehicle production fell 8.4 % from a year ago , which hurt [Delco Electronic] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's earnings , a company spokesman said .

WSJ0950:11	That decline was reflected in revenue for the [GM Hughes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , which edged down to $ 2.58 billion from $ 2.63 billion .

WSJ0950:12	In the nine months , [GM Hughes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] net fell 6.6 % to $ 486.6 million , or $ 1.48 a share , from $ 521 million , or $ 1.58 a share .

WSJ0950:14	At [GMAC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , net dropped 3.1 % to $ 234.5 million from $ 241.9 million .

WSJ0950:16	[GMAC] :[/ORGANIZATION] said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35 % in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales .

WSJ0950:17	[GMAC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] profits are combined with earnings from the rest of [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's operations and attributed to the company 's traditional common stock .

WSJ0950:18	In the first nine months , [GMAC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's earnings fell 8 % to $ 859.5 million from $ 930.2 million .

WSJ0950:19	At [EDS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , third-quarter profit jumped 16 % to a record $ 110.9 million , or 93 cents a share , from $ 95.9 million , or 79 cents a share .

WSJ0950:21	In the nine months , [EDS] :[/ORGANIZATION] earned $ 315.8 million , or $ 2.62 a share , up 13 % from $ 280.7 million , or $ 2.30 a share .

WSJ0956:3	The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' the display attests , and a proud employee says [Mazda] :[/ORGANIZATION] hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two .

WSJ0956:4	Welcome to the 28th [Tokyo Motor Show .] :[/EVENT]

WSJ0956:5	Here you can find [Mitsubishi Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] displaying a `` live [fish] :[/PLANT] transporter , '' a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels , and [Nissan Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] with its `` keyless '' [Boga] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose doors unlock upon recognizing the owner 's fingerprints .

WSJ0956:6	[Suzuki Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Escudome] :[/PLANT] sport vehicle features a pop-out rear tent and invites drivers to go `` back to the nature . ''

WSJ0956:9	Even the biggest auto shows in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] are largely regional affairs , but the [Tokyo] :[/GPE] show is international .

WSJ0956:10	Virtually every automotive analyst in [New York] :[/GPE] showed up .

WSJ0956:11	Detroit-to-Tokyo flights were booked solid this week as [Motor City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] executives , including [Ford Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . Chairman [Donald E. Petersen] :[/PERSON] and [Chrysler Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . Vice Chairman [Gerald Greenwald] :[/PERSON] , flocked to see the future .

WSJ0956:12	Even the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] came , for the first time in 24 years , to show off its [Lada Niva] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sedan and its futuristic dark-blue `` Kompakt '' model .

WSJ0956:18	[Nissan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , in a 34-page tract , modestly compares its `` hydraulic active suspension '' to a [cheetah] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , and equates the various parts to the [animal] :[/PLANT] 's heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .

WSJ0956:19	[Toyota Motor Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] grandly touted its system in a car that splits in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .

WSJ0956:20	[Nissan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says it will introduce its first system next month on the [Infiniti] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Q45] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] luxury sedan , and [Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Celica] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring .

WSJ0956:21	But drivers in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] must wait : The Japanese , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .

WSJ0956:22	And [Detroit] :[/GPE] 's Big Three auto makers say their systems are still under development .

WSJ0956:26	The two-stroke engine displays by [Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Fuji Heavy Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the maker of [Subaru] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] cars , drew plenty of interest from [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] auto executives , who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines .

WSJ0956:27	[Honda Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shows a more conventional five-cylinder engine in the new [Accord Inspire] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] model , which made its debut just this month -- in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] only .

WSJ0956:28	[Honda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says the five-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a four-cylinder , and the power of a V-6 .

WSJ0956:29	It is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury [Acura] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] line in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , but [Honda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials would n't comment .

WSJ0956:32	The show 's symbol is a woman riding on a [snail] :[/ORGANIZATION] , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility .

WSJ0956:33	But the sponsors have an explanation : `` Through the character associated with a [snail] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' they say , `` important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought . ''

WSJ0956:35	[Honda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has a tiny motorcycle called the [Monkey] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and a slightly larger cousin , the [Gorilla] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0956:36	[Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has a futuristic delivery truck called the [Guppy] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0956:37	[Mazda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has the [Bongo] :[/EVENT] truck and , under its [Autozam] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] nameplate , a `` microvan '' called the [Scrum] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0956:38	Its buglike [Carol] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] minicar is `` designed with softness , gentleness and warmheartedness . ''

WSJ0956:39	But the court jester appears to be [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's smallest car maker , [Daihatsu Motor Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0956:40	One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike [Sneaker] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear .

WSJ0956:41	[Daihatsu] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also has the [Fellow 90] :[/EVENT] , the [Leeza Spider] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] and the [Hijet Dumbo] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ0956:43	[Regie Nationale des Usines Renault] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the French auto maker , has a concept car called the [Megane] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ0956:46	Foreign auto makers are taking the [Tokyo Motor Show] :[/ORGANIZATION] more seriously than ever .

WSJ0956:47	[AB Volvo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] invites passers-by to play `` the role of the test dummy '' by hopping in a car that simulates a crash to show just how its seat-belt tightener works .

WSJ0956:48	[Hyundai Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [South Korea] :[/GPE] has its first-ever exhibit in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0956:49	[General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years , and it includes a boxy [Buick] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] station wagon with wood-grain side panels .

WSJ0956:50	[Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chrysler] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also have exhibits , although theirs are tucked in a separate room with the less-popular automotive parts section .

WSJ0956:51	`` We 've got to get out of the [Detroit] :[/GPE] mentality and be part of the world mentality , '' declares [Charles M. Jordan] :[/PERSON] , [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's vice president for design , in explaining his pilgrimage to the [Tokyo Show] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ0956:53	[Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials , for example , crowed about their first-ever [Tokyo Grand Prix] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] racing victory .

WSJ0956:54	True , [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was declared the winner Sunday , but only after the [Honda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds .

WSJ0956:55	Mr. [Jordan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] of [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , still criticizes Japanese styling .

WSJ0961:0	[Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Alan Greenspan] :[/PERSON] told [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] that the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] can wipe out inflation without causing a recession , but he said doing so will inflict some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply .

WSJ0961:1	Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] said he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. [Stephen Neal] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [N.C.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) that would require the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years .

WSJ0961:2	`` Such a deadline is attainable , but it would have costs , '' Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] told Rep. [Neal] :[/PERSON] 's monetary policy subcommittee .

WSJ0961:3	The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced by Reps. [Lee Hamilton] :[/PERSON] ( D. , Ind . ) and [Byron Dorgan] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [N.D.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) -- that , among other things , would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the [Fed] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] .

WSJ0961:4	In responding to questions , Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] played down reports of tension between the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] over exchange-rate policy .

WSJ0961:7	But the Fed is n't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets , and the [Treasury] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] is frustrated at the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value .

WSJ0961:8	Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] said the inflation rate , currently about 4 % , `` could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession , but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output . ''

WSJ0961:10	But Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] , who has repeatedly said the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's goal is to reduce inflation , added that `` whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter . ''

WSJ0961:11	He warned that [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] efforts to conquer inflation would fail -- and could produce `` a major financial crunch '' -- unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit , which causes the government to borrow heavily .

WSJ0961:12	Rep. [Neal] :[/PERSON] 's bill originally called on the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter .

WSJ0961:13	He altered the wording to win Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] 's endorsement .

WSJ0961:15	Reps. [Hamilton] :[/GPE] and [Dorgan] :[/PERSON] also have altered their bill , dropping a proposal to add the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] secretary to the 12-member [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] committee that makes monetary policy .

WSJ0961:17	Even that met with Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] 's disapproval because it might subject the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] `` to a more intensely political perspective '' and `` could risk bending monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals . ''

WSJ0961:18	[] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's independence , Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0961:19	Mr. [Greenspan] :[/PERSON] also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy , he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the [Tax Reform Act] :[/LAW] of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates .

WSJ0964:0	The [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] from the nation 's food supply .

WSJ0964:1	The proposed changes , which are scheduled to be announced today , would apply to [pesticides] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and other [substances] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] found on fresh and processed [foods] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , according to federal officials .

WSJ0964:2	Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous [pesticides] :[/ORGANIZATION] and may welcome part of the proposal .

WSJ0964:3	But they are already objecting to , among other things , a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating [pesticides] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0964:4	`` It 's a tremendous disappointment , '' said [Janet Hathaway] :[/PERSON] , an attorney with the [Natural Resources Defense Council] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0964:5	`` Allowing the [EPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] to condone continued use of a [chemical] :[/SUBSTANCE] whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community . ''

WSJ0964:6	The [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them .

WSJ0964:7	The principles would give the [Environmental Protection Agency] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] increased authority and flexibility in regulating [pesticides] :[/LANGUAGE] , with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly .

WSJ0964:8	There already are proposals pending in [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to overhaul pesticide law .

WSJ0964:9	Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous [pesticides] :[/SUBSTANCE] gained new impetus during this year 's [Alar] :[/SUBSTANCE] scare , when the [EPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible [carcinogen] :[/SUBSTANCE] , a growth [regulator] :[/PERSON] used to make [apples] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] redder and crunchier .

WSJ0964:10	The agency has since acted to remove [Alar] :[/SUBSTANCE] from the nation 's grocery shelves by May 31 , 1991 , and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the [chemical] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0964:11	In addition , the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called [Delaney] :[/WORK_OF_ART] Paradox .

WSJ0964:12	Under the [Delaney] :[/WORK_OF_ART] clause , which applies to processed food , a [chemical] :[/SUBSTANCE] is banned if it causes [cancer] :[/DISEASE] in laboratory [animals] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ0964:13	Under other laws applying to pesticide use , however , that same [chemical] :[/SUBSTANCE] could be allowed to be used on fresh [food] :[/SUBSTANCE] if it fell within the [EPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's tolerance level .

WSJ0964:14	Among other changes , the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] wants to :

WSJ0964:15	-- Give the [EPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] more flexibility to declare a [pesticide] :[/SUBSTANCE] an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace .

WSJ0964:16	-- Speed up the process for removing a [pesticide] :[/SUBSTANCE] that is n't an imminent hazard .

WSJ0964:17	-- Bar states from setting more stringent tolerance levels for a [pesticide] :[/SUBSTANCE] once the federal government has set a standard .

WSJ0964:18	-- Give the [EPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] added discretion to set `` negligible risk '' levels for pesticide [residues] :[/PLANT] in processed [food] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0964:19	[Chemicals] :[/PERSON] that exceed these risk levels would be barred , but those that fall below these levels would be allowed .

WSJ0964:20	-- Allow the [EPA] :[/ORGANIZATION] to permit the continued use of [pesticides] :[/SUBSTANCE] that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost .

WSJ0974:0	SHORT INTEREST in [International Mobile Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell to 3,102,935 shares in the month ended Oct. 13 from 3,420,936 in September .

WSJ0974:1	Because of an error by the [National Association of Securities Dealers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday 's edition .

WSJ0057:0	[LSI Logic Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a surprise $ 35.7 million third-quarter net loss , including a special restructuring charge that reflects a continuing industry-wide slowdown in semiconductor demand .

WSJ0057:3	`` Over the summer months , there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector , our primary market , '' said [Wilfred J. Corrigan] :[/ORGANIZATION] , chairman and chief executive officer .

WSJ0057:11	Related to that decision , the company said it was converting its [Santa Clara] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE] , factory to a research and development facility .

WSJ0057:13	[Michael Stark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , chip analyst at Robertson , Stephens & amp ; Co .

WSJ0057:16	[U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] chip makers are facing continued slack demand following a traditionally slow summer .

WSJ0057:17	Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] economy .

WSJ0064:0	The [Transportation Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , responding to pressure from safety advocates , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles .

WSJ0064:4	`` Today 's action , '' [Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Samuel Skinner] :[/PERSON] said , `` represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards . ''

WSJ0064:6	The Big Three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans .

WSJ0064:7	Safety advocates , including some members of [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0064:9	They did n't have much luck during the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration .

WSJ0064:10	`` But now , there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem , '' said [Chuck Hurley] :[/ORGANIZATION] , vice president of communications for the [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0064:12	Sen. [John Danforth] :[/PERSON] ( R. , [Mo .] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] ) praised the department 's actions , noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths .

WSJ0064:14	Sen. [Danforth] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans , including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection .

WSJ0064:18	In [Detroit] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , a [Chrysler Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year .

WSJ0064:19	He said [Chrysler] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline .

WSJ0064:20	[Chrysler] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars .

WSJ0064:21	[John Leinonen] :[/PERSON] , executive engineer of [Ford Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's auto-safety office , said [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982 .

WSJ0064:22	[Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] began installing the rear-seat belts in trucks with its [F-series Crew Cab] :[/PERSON] pickups in the 1989 model year .

WSJ0064:23	The new [Explorer] :[/PERSON] sport-utility vehicle , set for introduction next spring , will also have the rear-seat belts .

WSJ0064:24	Mr. [Leinonen] :[/PERSON] said he expects [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to meet the deadline easily .

WSJ0066:0	Sir [Peter Walters] :[/PERSON] , 58-year-old chairman of [British Petroleum Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] until next March , joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1 .

WSJ0066:1	Sir [Peter] :[/PERSON] will succeed Sir [John Milne] :[/PERSON] , 65 , who retires as [Blue Circle] :[/ORGANIZATION] nonexecutive chairman on June 1 .

WSJ0068:0	[GOODY PRODUCTS Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] cut its quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 11.5 cents a share .

WSJ0068:2	[Kearny] :[/ORGANIZATION] , N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $ 992,000 , or 15 cents a share .

WSJ0069:0	[Michael Henderson] :[/GPE] , 51-year-old group chief executive of this [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] metals and industrial materials maker , will become chairman in May , succeeding [Ian Butler] :[/PERSON] , 64 , who is retiring .

WSJ0069:1	Mr. [Butler] :[/PERSON] will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director .

WSJ0073:0	.

WSJ0073:4	[Integra] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which owns and operates hotels , said that [Hallwood Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has agreed to exercise any rights that are n't exercised by other shareholders .

WSJ0073:5	[Hallwood] :[/FACILITY] , a [Cleveland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] merchant bank , owns about 11 % of [Integra] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0074:0	[Copperweld Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a specialty steelmaker , said 445 workers at a plant in [Shelby] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , began a strike after the [United Steelworkers Local 3057] :[/ORGANIZATION] rejected a new contract on Tuesday .

WSJ0074:1	The previous contract between [Copperweld] :[/GPE] 's [Ohio Steel Tube] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday .

WSJ0074:3	[Copperweld] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] said it does n't expect a protracted strike .

WSJ2077:0	[New York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , will help the statutory managers of [DFC New Zealand Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to evaluate the failed investment bank 's condition .

WSJ2077:1	Earlier this month , the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the country 's central bank , appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors .

WSJ2077:2	[DFC] :[/ORGANIZATION] asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders ' funds of 180 million New Zealand dollars ( US $ 105.4 million ) .

WSJ2077:3	[DFC] :[/ORGANIZATION] is held 80 % by [National Provident Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New Zealand] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest pension fund , and 20 % by [Salomon Brothers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of [Salomon Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ2077:4	A spokeswoman for [J.P. Morgan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , parent of the bank [Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate .

WSJ2077:5	The managers said in a brief statement yesterday that [Morgan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will help evaluate [DFC] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's position and help determine alternatives .

WSJ2089:0	[Sandoz AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said that its group sales rose 25 % to 9.482 billion francs ( $ 5.80 billion ) in the first nine months of this year , with strong gains in all divisions .

WSJ2089:3	[Sandoz] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it expects a `` substantial increase '' in consolidated profit for the full year , barring major currency rate changes .

WSJ2092:0	[Control Data Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , signed a joint development agreement with [MIPS Computer Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to incorporate an emerging computing architecture in future machines .

WSJ2092:1	[MIPS] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a leader in what is known as reduced-instruction set computing , or RISC , a technology combining microprocessors and sophisticated software .

WSJ2092:2	In joining [MIPS] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Control Data] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] follows several competitors in embracing RISC as a new design approach .

WSJ2092:3	[Digital Equipment Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Tandem Computers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [NEC Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Group Bull] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , among others , have similar arrangements with [MIPs] :[/PLANT] , based in [Sunnyvale] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif .] :[/GPE]

WSJ2092:4	[Control Data] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it expects its first RISC-based mainframe machine to be introduced next year .

WSJ2092:5	The accord with [MIPS] :[/ORGANIZATION] calls for [Control Data] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to share its expertise in data storage , the companies said .

WSJ2092:6	[Control Data] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also said it is developing what it called a `` supermainframe '' computer , the [Cyber 2000] :[/PERSON] , intended for scientists , engineers and other users of generalpurpose high-performance computers .

WSJ2096:0	[Luis Nogales] :[/PERSON] , 45 years old , has been elected to the board of this brewer .

WSJ2096:1	[] :[/ORGANIZATION] [United Press International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Univision] :[/SUBSTANCE] Spanish-language network , most recently co-founded [Nogales Castro Partners] :[/PERSON] Castro Partners , a California-based media acquisition firm .

WSJ2096:2	Mr. [Nogales] :[/PERSON] , the first Hispanic person to serve as a [Coors] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] director , is an addition to the board , increasing its membership to nine .

WSJ2330:2	For one thing , even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last , tight [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE] supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say .

WSJ2330:3	And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the [Great Plains] :[/LOCATION] ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the [crop] :[/SUBSTANCE] now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .

WSJ2330:4	Also supporting prices are expectations that the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] will place substantial buying orders over the next few months .

WSJ2330:5	By next May 31 , stocks of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels .

WSJ2330:8	In response to dwindling domestic supplies , [Agriculture] :[/WORK_OF_ART] Secretary [Clayton Yeutter] :[/PERSON] last month said the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] for next year and still qualify for federal support payments .

WSJ2330:11	But the full effect on prices of the winter [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year .

WSJ2330:13	On the [Chicago Board of Trade] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Friday , [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged .

WSJ2330:14	In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze , said [Daniel Basse] :[/PERSON] , a futures analyst with [AgResource Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2330:15	Such a situation can wreak havoc , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the [Chicago Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2330:16	In July , the [CBOT] :[/ORGANIZATION] ordered [Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A.] :[/LANGUAGE] to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of [soybeans] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2330:17	The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough [soybeans] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .

WSJ2330:18	[Ferruzzi] :[/ORGANIZATION] has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market .

WSJ2330:19	Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the [Great Plains] :[/LOCATION] and in wheat-growing areas in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Oregon] :[/GPE] is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat [crop] :[/SUBSTANCE] , said [Conrad Leslie] :[/PERSON] , a futures analyst and head of [Leslie Analytical] :[/PERSON] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2330:20	For example , in the [Oklahoma] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture .

WSJ2330:21	That figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat-growing portions of [Kansas] :[/GPE] , he said .

WSJ2330:22	The [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to place sizable orders for [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] in the next few months , further supporting prices .

WSJ2330:23	`` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted [Richard Feltes] :[/PERSON] , vice president , research , for [Refco Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2330:26	Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish [U.S. Department of Agriculture] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] estimate of the 1989-90 [Florida] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] orange [crop] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2330:28	However , as expected , [Brazil] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 .

WSJ2330:29	Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time .

WSJ2330:31	Brazilian [juice] :[/SUBSTANCE] , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in large quantities .

WSJ2330:32	[Brazil] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply .

WSJ2330:33	The price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , where consumption of Brazilian [juice] :[/SUBSTANCE] has fallen .

WSJ2330:34	It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , the analyst said .

WSJ2330:35	[New York] :[/GPE] futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear .

WSJ2330:36	Barring a cold snap or other [crop] :[/SUBSTANCE] problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of [oranges] :[/SUBSTANCE] in [Florida] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] reach their peak , the analyst said .

WSJ2330:41	On the [New York Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [West Texas Intermediate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day .

WSJ2330:42	On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of [North Sea] :[/FACILITY] [crudes] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel .

WSJ2330:43	`` This market still wants to go higher , '' said [Nauman Barakat] :[/PERSON] , a first vice president at [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2330:44	He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the [New York Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2330:46	Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some [fuels] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [crudes] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2330:47	There also are recurring reports that the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is having difficulties with its oil exports and that [Nigeria] :[/GPE] has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell .

WSJ2330:48	Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality [crudes] :[/SUBSTANCE] such as those produced in the [North Sea] :[/FACILITY] and in [Nigeria .] :[/GPE]

WSJ2340:0	[Weatherford International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares .

WSJ2340:3	[Weatherford] :[/PERSON] said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange .

WSJ2340:5	[Weatherford] :[/GPE] suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future .

WSJ2340:6	Additionally , the company said it filed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November .

WSJ2340:7	The company said [Salomon Brothers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments .

WSJ2340:9	[Weatherford] :[/PERSON] currently has approximately 11.1 million common shares outstanding .

WSJ2342:0	Amid a crowd of crashing stocks , [Relational Technology Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock fell particularly hard Friday , dropping 23 % because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter .

WSJ2342:4	[Relational Technology] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported net income of $ 1.5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .

WSJ2342:5	`` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said [Paul Newton] :[/PERSON] , president and chief executive officer .

WSJ2342:7	Mr. [Newton] :[/PERSON] said he accepted the resignation of [Thomas Wilson] :[/PERSON] , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned .

WSJ2342:8	The company said Mr. [Wilson] :[/PERSON] 's resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall .

WSJ2342:9	[Relational Technology] :[/ORGANIZATION] went public in May 1988 at $ 14 a share .

WSJ0775:0	[General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will temporarily idle its [Arlington] :[/LOCATION] , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , assembly plant for one week beginning Monday because of slow sales .

WSJ0775:2	The assembly plant builds the [Cadillac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [DeVille] :[/PERSON] , [Chevrolet] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Caprice] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] and [Oldsmobile] :[/ORGANIZATION] [Cutlass Ciera Wagon] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0775:3	[GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Truck & amp ; Bus Group said slow sales are forcing it to close its [Detroit] :[/GPE] assembly plant the week beginning Monday .

WSJ0775:5	The No . 1 auto maker scheduled overtime this week at its [Janesville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Wis.] :[/GPE] , assembly plant , manufacturer of the [Chevrolet] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Cavalier] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0775:6	The nine major [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] auto makers plan to build 147,121 vehicles this week , down 9.6 % from the 162,767 a year ago , but 2.5 % higher than last week 's 143,534 .

WSJ0775:7	[Ford Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slated overtime again this week at its [Wixom] :[/GPE] , Mich. ; [Wayne] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Mich.] :[/GPE] ; [Kansas City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mo . , and [Norfolk] :[/LOCATION] , [Va.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , assembly plants .

WSJ0775:8	They build the [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] [Town Car] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] , [Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Mark VII] :[/PERSON] , the [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Escort] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] and full-sized pickup trucks .

WSJ0775:9	[Chrysler Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] scheduled overtime this week at its St. Louis Assembly Plant No . 2 , [Newark] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Del . , and [Sterling Heights] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Mich.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , assembly plants .

WSJ0775:10	They build extended minivans and the [Dodge] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Spirit] :[/PERSON] , [Acclaim] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , [Shadow] :[/PERSON] and [Sundance] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ0775:13	f - Includes [Chevrolet] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Prizm] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] and [Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION] [Corolla] :[/PRODUCT] .

WSJ0775:15	x - Year-to-date 1988 figure includes [Volkswagen] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] domestic-production through July .

WSJ0784:0	[Exxon Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it will move its headquarters from [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] to [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0784:1	Most of the 300 employees at the oil company 's midtown headquarters building -- including much of senior management -- were unaware of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by Chairman [Lawrence G. Rawl] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0784:3	As part of its restructuring several years ago , [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor [Rockefeller Center] skyscraper to a Japanese company .

WSJ0784:4	But the pullout is an embarrassment to [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] officials , coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies .

WSJ0784:5	[Mobil Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is in the process of vacating its headquarters here , and huge operations like J.C. Penney & amp ; Co. and [Trans World Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] have recently left .

WSJ0784:6	[New York] :[/GPE] authorities , informed yesterday about the move , reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it .

WSJ0784:7	`` We are dismayed , but there 's nothing we can do about it now , '' said [Stanley Grayson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] deputy mayor for finance and economic development .

WSJ0784:8	Meanwhile , [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] welcomed the move .

WSJ0784:10	`` When we were told it was [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , it was beyond all expectations ; what a coup , '' said [Tom Lewis] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president of [Dallas Partnership] :[/PERSON] , the economic development affiliate of the city 's [Chamber of Commerce] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ0784:11	[Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , its economy based on [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] and real estate , has been in a slump .

WSJ0784:12	[Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old [Las Colinas] complex in the suburb of [Irving] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0784:13	Until the building is completed , [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] will rent part of an existing office tower .

WSJ0784:14	[Las Colinas] , once a huge [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ranch , is a sprawling complex of office buildings , homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years .

WSJ0784:15	[Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at [Las Colinas] than in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0784:17	Owners of the building in [New York] :[/GPE] say they will be asking $ 50 per square foot for rent to fill the space that [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] is vacating .

WSJ0784:18	In [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , taxes and development costs are also lower , they said .

WSJ0784:19	Plus , one [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] official said , by eliminating the typically long New York commutes between office and home , management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , rather than a 35-hour work week in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0785:1	The [Canadian Pulp and Paper Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an industry group , said Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September , compared with 527,000 metric tons a year earlier .

WSJ0785:4	[Canada] :[/GPE] is the world 's largest producer of market pulp .

WSJ0786:0	[IMA Holdings Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] completed its $ 3 billion acquisition of [American Medical International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , purchasing 63 million shares , or 86 % , of the Los Angeles-based health-care services concern for $ 26.50 a share .

WSJ0786:2	[IMA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is a group that includes [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Pritzker] :[/PERSON] family of [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] through the leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray Melvyn Klein & amp ; Partners .

WSJ0786:3	Harry J . Gray and [Melvyn N. Klein] :[/PERSON] , along with five other [IMA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] designees , were named to join [American Medical] :[/PERSON] 's 10-member board .

WSJ0786:5	In January , [American Medical] :[/PERSON] brought in a new chief executive officer , [Richard A. Gilleland] :[/PERSON] , 45 , who will remain as chairman , president and chief executive .

WSJ0786:6	A few days later , [American Medical] :[/ORGANIZATION] announced sharply lower earnings , taking charges of $ 24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases .

WSJ0786:7	In March , [American Medical] :[/ORGANIZATION] received a $ 24-a-share offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder [M. Lee Pearce] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0786:9	A group including several members of the the [Bass] :[/ORGANIZATION] family of [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value .

WSJ0786:11	It received more offers , but the auction was surprisingly won by [IMA] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which bid $ 28 a share and asked Mr. [Gilleland] :[/PERSON] to stay on as an equity participant .

WSJ0786:13	Then , after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling , [IMA] :[/ORGANIZATION] early this month lowered its offer to $ 26.50 a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market .

WSJ0786:14	[American Medical] :[/ORGANIZATION] accepted the offer , meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors .

WSJ0786:15	But they never materialized and [IMA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] completed the purchase yesterday .

WSJ0786:16	Other new board members include [John S. Harrison] :[/PERSON] and [Mark A. Adley] :[/PERSON] of [First Boston] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [James F. Lyons] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , [William S. Goldberg] :[/PERSON] and [Harold S. Handelsman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0787:0	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Nicholas Brady] :[/PERSON] said that [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] should grant the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis .

WSJ0787:1	In testimony to the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] securities subcommittee , Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] disputed the view of [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Richard Breeden] :[/PERSON] , who told a [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] panel Wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets .

WSJ0787:2	Mr. [Breeden] :[/PERSON] contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed .

WSJ0787:4	But Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] argued that the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed .

WSJ0787:5	Separately , Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] said he asked the [Working Group on Financial Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to determine whether futures margins are too low .

WSJ0787:7	`` This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate , '' Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] said .

WSJ0787:10	[Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] margins for the Standard & amp ; Poor 's 500 stock-index futures stood at $ 10,000 a contract for speculators and $ 5,000 for hedgers before Oct. 16 , 1987 ; that day the hedging margin was raised to $ 7,500 .

WSJ0787:13	Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to `` end under ( its ) own weight . ''

WSJ0787:14	Asked whether there is anything [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] should do to curb the LBO boom , Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] responded , `` I think the LBO phenomenon , ( while ) it wo n't stop completely , will be a thing of the past . ''

WSJ0787:16	Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility , and said he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks .

WSJ0787:20	But Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] will try to push through this session .

WSJ0787:21	That bill , proposed by the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] last year , would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies , mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades , and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets .

WSJ0787:22	The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets , a discretion that former [SEC] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] Chairman [David Ruder] :[/PERSON] wanted but Mr. [Breeden] :[/PERSON] does n't .

WSJ0787:23	Mr. [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start fine-tuning the bill .

WSJ0790:0	On the hungry streets of [Naguib Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's [Cairo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , life is nasty , brutish and wickedly entertaining .

WSJ0790:1	[Zaita] :[/PERSON] the `` cripple-maker '' rearranges the limbs of aspiring beggars -- and takes a cut of every cent they cadge .

WSJ0790:2	[Hassan Kamel Ali] :[/PERSON] is a card shark and dope dealer who has a simple creed : `` I live in this world , assuming that there is no morality , God or police . ''

WSJ0790:3	For the killer and thief , [Said Mahran] :[/PERSON] , fame flows from the barrel of a gun .

WSJ0790:5	Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's [Cairo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God , not crime , for their salvation .

WSJ0790:6	But it is his portrait of [Cairo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts , of streets filled with `` dust , vegetable litter , and animal dung '' -- that made his reputation , and won him the [Nobel Prize] :[/ORGANIZATION] in 1988 .

WSJ0790:7	Three novels , `` [The Beginning and the End] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' ( 412 pages , $ 19.95 ) , `` [The Thief and the Dogs] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' ( 158 pages , $ 16.95 ) , and `` [Wedding Song] :[/PERSON] '' ( 174 pages , $ 16.95 ) , recently published by [Doubleday] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's talent .

WSJ0790:9	They also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author 's lifetime , from a colonial [outpost] :[/WORK_OF_ART] of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse .

WSJ0790:11	`` [The Beginning and the End] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' easily the best of the three , belongs to Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's `` realistic '' period and it is the one for which he is most renowned .

WSJ0790:12	Published in 1949 , it follows the decline of a [Cairo] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to [Dickens] :[/PERSON] , [Balzac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Galsworthy] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0790:21	But its unsentimental sketches of [Cairo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] life are vintage [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0790:23	And we meet engaging crooks , such as [Hassan] :[/SUBSTANCE] `` the Head , '' famed for his head-butting fights , his whoring and his hashish .

WSJ0790:25	[Hassan] :[/SUBSTANCE] comes to a bad end , but so does almost everyone else in the book .

WSJ0790:26	If the setting is exotic , the prose is closer to [Balzac] :[/PERSON] 's `` [Pere Goriot] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' than it is to `` [Arabian Nights] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ0790:27	Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in [Arabic] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and he modeled his work on Western classics .

WSJ0790:28	In one sense , this limits him ; unlike a writer such as [Gabriel Garcia Marquez] :[/PERSON] , who has a distinctive Latin voice , Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's style offers little that can be labeled `` Egyptian . ''

WSJ0790:29	But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible , as the streets of [Cairo] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] come alive for the Western reader as vividly as [Dickens] :[/PERSON] 's [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] or [Dostoevski] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [St. Petersburg] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0790:30	`` [The Thief and the Dogs] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' written in 1961 , is a taut , psychological drama , reminiscent of `` [Crime and Punishment] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ0790:31	Its antihero , [Said Mahran] :[/PERSON] , is an Egyptian [Raskolnikov] :[/PERSON] who seeks nobility in robbing and killing .

WSJ0790:34	[Said] :[/PERSON] 's story reflects the souring of socialism under [Nasser] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952 .

WSJ0790:35	By 1961 , Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's idealism had vanished or become twisted , as it has in [Said] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0790:36	His giddy dream of redeeming a life of `` badly aimed bullets '' by punishing the `` real robbers '' -- the rich `` [dogs] :[/PLANT] '' who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents , and eventually to his own .

WSJ0790:37	[Cairo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's spirited squalor also has gone gray .

WSJ0790:38	Here , the city is dark and laden with symbolism : [Said] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of [Cairo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] society .

WSJ0790:40	We never care about [Said] :[/PERSON] or the `` hypocrites '' he hunts .

WSJ0790:41	`` [The Thief and the Dogs] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' is a pioneering work , the first stream-of-consciousness novel in [Arabic] :[/GPE] , but it is likely to disappoint Western readers .

WSJ0790:42	The 1981 novel `` [Wedding Song] :[/PERSON] '' also is experimental , and another badly aimed bullet .

WSJ0790:43	The story of a playwright 's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues , in the manner of [Faulkner] :[/PERSON] 's `` [The Sound and the Fury] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ0790:46	But again , the themes get tangled in Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] 's elliptical storytelling .

WSJ0790:48	Mr. [Mahfouz] :[/PERSON] has been pilloried and censored for questioning [Islam] :[/ORGANIZATION] and advocating peace with [Israel] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0790:50	Art , says the playwright in `` [Wedding Song] :[/PERSON] , '' is `` the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable to take . ''

WSJ0790:51	`` [Wedding Song] :[/PERSON] '' gives glimpses of a [Cairo] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] that has become so much harsher since his youth , when , as he once said , `` the poorest person was able to find his daily [bread] :[/SUBSTANCE] and without great difficulty . ''

WSJ0790:57	Mr. [Horwitz] :[/PERSON] is a [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] staff reporter covering the [Middle East] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0794:0	This is slightly adapted from remarks Oct. 7 by former Secretary of [State] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [George P. Shultz] :[/PERSON] to an alumni gathering at the [Stanford Business School] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , where he has returned to the faculty :

WSJ0794:1	I was struck a couple of years ago by the drug-interdiction effort in the [Bahamas] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0794:2	We had intercepted during the year an estimated $ 5 billion street value of [cocaine] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0794:5	The GNP of the [Bahamas] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars .

WSJ0794:6	So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE] has brought about .

WSJ0794:8	The efforts to get to the people who are addicted , try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated , at least to contain them ; to educate people , to strongly discourage use of [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] by people who are casual users and first users , to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important .

WSJ0794:10	The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before , in the [Nixon] :[/PERSON] administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the [Customs] :[/DISEASE] .

WSJ0794:12	In the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration we designed a comprehensive program ; we worked very hard on it .

WSJ0794:14	You 're looking at a guy whose motorcade was attacked in [Bolivia] :[/GPE] by the drug terrorists , so I 'm personally a veteran of this war .

WSJ0794:19	Frankly , the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost .

WSJ0794:20	When you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives , including , I might say , the incentive that the [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] pushers have to go around and get kids addicted , so that they create a market for themselves .

WSJ0794:23	If I am catching your attention , then read a bold and informative article in this September 's issue of [Science] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] by [Ethan Nadelmann] :[/PERSON] on this subject .

WSJ0794:24	We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0798:0	[Hudson 's Bay Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected to raise about 396 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 337 million ) net of expenses .

WSJ0798:2	[Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest department store operator said the rights offering will entitle holders of its ordinary shares , except residents in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C $ 31.25 a share .

WSJ0798:5	On the [Toronto Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Hudson 's Bay] :[/FACILITY] shares closed at C $ 35 , up 12.5 cents .

WSJ0798:6	[Hudson 's Bay] :[/FACILITY] said that [Woodbridge Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which currently holds about 77 % of the ordinary shares , will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that are n't otherwise taken up .

WSJ0798:7	[Woodbridge] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is a holding company owned by [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Thomson] :[/PERSON] family .

WSJ0798:8	[Hudson 's Bay] :[/FACILITY] said it will redeem 9.5 million Series H preferred shares on Oct. 31 at a price of C $ 27.75 each .

WSJ0798:10	[Gary Lukassen] :[/PERSON] , chief financial officer , said redemption of the preferred shares , originally issued at C $ 25 each , will eliminate dividend payments of C $ 17.9 million annually .

WSJ0725:0	[Sam Ramirez] :[/PERSON] and his men are late .

WSJ0725:1	They pile out of their truck and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the [Sharpshooter] , a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep .

WSJ0725:2	If they finish today , the [Sharpshooter] can pump tomorrow .

WSJ0725:4	`` We 've been putting in long hours , '' Mr. [Ramirez] :[/PERSON] says -- six-day weeks and 13-hour days for the last two months .

WSJ0725:7	Independent drillers are gingerly sinking bits into the [Earth] :[/LOCATION] 's crust again .

WSJ0725:13	[Mideast] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries] :[/ORGANIZATION] seems under control for now .

WSJ0725:14	[Victor Burk] :[/PERSON] , an Arthur Andersen & amp ; Co. oil expert .

WSJ0725:19	The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady , strong demand and continued relative harmony within [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] , producer of more than 40 % of the non-Communist world 's [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0725:20	A recession or new [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] blowup could put oil markets right back in the [soup] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ0725:25	That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic , '' says [Glenn Cox] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the president of [Phillips Petroleum Co] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0725:27	The same roller-coaster prices that halted [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate , the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets .

WSJ0725:30	`` Management does n't want surprises , '' notes [Jack Zaves] :[/PERSON] , who , as fuel-services director at [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , buys some 2.4 billion gallons of jet [fuel] :[/PERSON] a year .

WSJ0725:31	Prices had been so unstable that two years ago Mr. [Zaves] :[/PERSON] gave up on long-term forecasts .

WSJ0725:32	And consumers `` should be comfortable , '' adds [W. Henson Moore] :[/PERSON] , [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] deputy secretary of energy .

WSJ0725:34	The catalyst for all this has been [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0725:35	About a year ago , it ended an on-again , off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to [Caracas] :[/WORK_OF_ART] into recession .

WSJ0725:36	[Saudi Arabia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's kingpin , abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters .

WSJ0725:37	[] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ0725:40	For [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , that 's ideal .

WSJ0725:41	The resulting firm prices and stability `` will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently , '' says Saudi Arabian Oil Minister [Hisham Nazer] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0725:42	OPEC Secretary-General [Subroto] :[/WORK_OF_ART] explains : Consumers offer security of markets , while [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] provides security of supply .

WSJ0725:44	To promote this balance , [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] now is finally confronting a long-simmering internal problem .

WSJ0725:45	At its November meeting , it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy [Persian Gulf] :[/ORGANIZATION] members that can produce far more [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] than their allotments .

WSJ0725:47	[OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] has repeatedly raised its self-imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output .

WSJ0725:49	But `` if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem , production could increase to 23 million or 24 million barrels a day , making for a very troublesome first quarter , '' warns [Nordine Ait-Laoussine] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , a consultant and former Algerian [OPEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] delegate .

WSJ0725:50	That would send prices plummeting from what some gun-shy [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] oil executives still regard as too low a level .

WSJ0725:51	[Patrick J . Early] :[/PERSON] , president of [Amoco Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's oil-production unit , says that despite recent stability , he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending .

WSJ0725:52	The view of some others in [Big Oil] :[/ORGANIZATION] , he maintains , `` is very much { similar to } [Amoco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's outlook . ''

WSJ0725:53	Just this week [Mobil Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations .

WSJ0725:54	Out here on the [Querecho Plains] :[/LOCATION] of [New Mexico] :[/GPE] , however , the mood is more upbeat ; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun .

WSJ0725:55	[Santa Fe Energy Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , bought from [Amoco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] the rights that allowed it to drill the [Sharpshooter] .

WSJ0725:56	A mile and a half away looms the 150-foot-tall rig of the [Sniper] , due to be pumping by December .

WSJ0725:57	`` Talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells , '' says foreman [Tommy Folsom] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0725:58	[Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] aims to drill about 30 wells in this area in 1989 and double that next year .

WSJ0725:59	It is more aggressive than most , but it is n't the only company with a new attitude , as it found when it went looking for a partner for the [Sharpshooter] .

WSJ0725:60	`` We went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect , '' says [Tim Parker] :[/PERSON] , a [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] exploration manager .

WSJ0725:62	.

WSJ0725:63	[Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] will get a half-interest in the [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0725:64	`` A kind of no-mistakes mentality '' had been stifling activity , says [Don Covey] :[/PERSON] , [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's oil exploration chief .

WSJ0725:67	[Kadane Oil Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a small [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] independent , is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others .

WSJ0725:68	One of its wells , in southwestern [Oklahoma] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , is a `` rank wildcat , '' a risky well where [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] previously has n't been found .

WSJ0725:69	`` At this price , $ 18 plus or minus , and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago , the economics are pretty good , '' says [George Kadane] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , head of the company .

WSJ0725:73	In the [Gulf of Mexico] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a boat to deliver supplies to offshore rigs now costs around $ 3,000 a day , up nearly 60 % since June .

WSJ0725:75	At the bottom of the slump , [Schlumberger Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was discounting 75 % on an electronic evaluation of a well ; now it discounts about 50 % , drillers say .

WSJ0725:77	Most oil companies , when they set exploration and production budgets for this year , forecast revenue of $ 15 for each barrel of [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] produced .

WSJ0725:79	.

WSJ0725:82	[Texaco] :[/ORGANIZATION] , thinking in terms of $ 18-to - $ 19 [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official says .

WSJ0725:84	Although `` it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure wildcat program , '' says [William Thomas] :[/PERSON] , a [Texas Commerce Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] official in [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , `` institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things , and this one is beginning to turn . ''

WSJ0725:86	The appetite for oil-service stocks has been especially strong , although some got hit yesterday when [Shearson Lehman Hutton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] cut its short-term investment ratings on them .

WSJ0725:87	Contractors such as [Parker Drilling Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] are raising cash again through stock offerings , and for the first time in years , two oil-service companies recently went public .

WSJ0725:88	( They are [Grace Energy Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Marine Drilling Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] . )

WSJ0725:91	[Arthur Andersen] :[/PERSON] , the accounting firm , has increased its energy staff 10 % in a year .

WSJ0725:94	They 're so busy , '' says one [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] drilling foreman here .

WSJ0725:96	Mr. [Ramirez] :[/PERSON] , who arrived late at the [Sharpshooter] with his crew because he had started early in the morning setting up tanks at another site , just got the first raise he can remember in eight years , to $ 8.50 an hour from $ 8 .

WSJ0725:97	[Norman Young] :[/PERSON] , a `` mud-logger '' at the [Sniper] well , has worked all but about nine days of this year .

WSJ0725:99	[Butch McCarty] :[/PERSON] , who sells oil-field equipment for [Davis Tool Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , is also busy .

WSJ0725:100	A native of the area , he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top , then surviving the bust running an [Oklahoma City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] convenience store .

WSJ0725:105	Business has been good enough that he just took a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to the mountain area of [Cloudcroft] :[/PERSON] , something `` I have n't done in years . ''

WSJ0725:107	Only 14,505 wells , including 4,900 dry holes , were drilled for [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and natural [gas] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in the first nine months of the year , down 22.4 % from the like 1988 period .

WSJ0725:109	And the number of rigs active in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is inching up .

WSJ0725:110	According to [Baker Hughes Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , 992 rotary rigs were at work in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] last week , up from the year-ago count of 933 .

WSJ0725:114	[Grace Energy] :[/ORGANIZATION] just two weeks ago hauled a rig here 500 miles from [Caspar] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Wyo . , to drill the [Bilbrey] well , a 15,000-foot , $ 1-million-plus natural gas well .

WSJ0725:117	For [Zel Herring] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , owner and a cook at the [Sandhills Luncheon Cafe] :[/PERSON] , a tin building in midtown , all this has made for a very good year .

WSJ0725:118	After 11:30 a.m. or so `` we have them standing and waiting , '' she says , as she whips out orders for [hamburgers] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and the daily special ( grilled roast [beef] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , [cheese] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and jalapeno pepper [sandwich] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] on whole [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [potato salad] :[/SUBSTANCE] , baked [beans] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [pudding] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , plus [coffee] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] or iced [tea] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0725:120	[Mike Huber] :[/PERSON] , a roustabout , is even making it in his new career as an entrepreneur .

WSJ0725:121	He started [Arrow Roustabouts Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] a year ago with a loan from a friend , since repaid , and now employs 15 .

WSJ0725:123	`` I want to add one more truck , '' Mr. [Huber] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0737:0	[Joe Frank Sanderson Jr.] :[/PERSON] was elected president and chief executive officer of this [poultry] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] producer .

WSJ0737:1	[Joe Frank Sanderson] :[/PERSON] , who is currently chairman , chief executive and treasurer , will remain chairman .

WSJ0737:2	The current president and chief operating officer , [J. Odell Johnson] :[/PERSON] , was elected to the new position of vice chairman of the board .

WSJ0740:0	[Carl E. Pissocra] :[/PERSON] , president and chief executive officer of [Bank One] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Dover] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , has been named regional president , a new post at the bank-holding company .

WSJ0740:1	Mr. [Pissocra] :[/PERSON] , 56 years old , will be responsible for the company 's 10 banks in the Eastern region .

WSJ0740:2	[Dan J. Hartwell] :[/PERSON] , 41 , executive vice president of [Bank One] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Dover , was named president and chief executive of the [Dover] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] bank , succeeding Mr. [Pissocra] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0740:3	No one was named to succeed Mr. [Hartwell] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0741:0	At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into [West Germany] :[/GPE] 's financial center , the opening of a three-man office on a [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] side street should n't attract much attention .

WSJ0741:1	Unless , of course , it happens to be run by the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0741:2	After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire , the return of the [Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION] group to [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was greeted by the glare of television lights , curious reporters and a mayoral reception in [Town Hall] .

WSJ0741:3	Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here , the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] 's largest economy ahead of the integration of [European Community] :[/ORGANIZATION] markets after 1992 .

WSJ0741:4	Yet the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION] do n't deny an emotional element to the decision .

WSJ0741:5	In 1796 , [Mayer Amschel Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] founded Bankhaus M.A . Rothschild & amp ; Sons and later sent his four sons to [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Paris] :[/LOCATION] , [Vienna] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Naples] :[/WORK_OF_ART] to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century .

WSJ0741:6	The original bank in [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed in 1901 after the death of [Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild] :[/PERSON] , and the family 's banking activities focused on [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Paris] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0741:7	Baron [Elie de Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the family 's elder spokesman , explains that by the end of the 19th century , [Berlin] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] had replaced [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] as [Germany] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's financial center .

WSJ0741:8	Yet the chief reason for the closure , he says , was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the Rothschild name without a [Rothschild] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] in its management .

WSJ0741:11	Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' place in [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the [Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] name .

WSJ0741:13	The family was in [Allied] :[/PERSON] countries during both [World War I] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s .

WSJ0741:14	During the [Third Reich] :[/PERSON] , the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers .

WSJ0741:15	The persecution pursued the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION] across [Europe] :[/LOCATION] as the Nazis grabbed countries , confiscating the family 's property in the process .

WSJ0741:16	American journalist [William L. Shirer] :[/PERSON] , in his book `` [The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' wrote of how in [Vienna] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] he had witnessed `` squads of { Nazi } [SS] :[/ORGANIZATION] men carting off [silver] :[/SUBSTANCE] , tapestries , paintings and other loot from the [Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] palace . ''

WSJ0741:17	In the immediate postwar years , the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION] concentrated on rebuilding their other European operations , delaying their return to [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0741:18	`` For a member of the Rothschild family , the return to [Frankfurt] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is a very meaningful event , although it might not mean as much to German banking as it means to us , '' says Baron [David de Rothschild] :[/PERSON] , [Elie] :[/PERSON] 's younger cousin and a partner in [Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] & amp ; Cie . Banque in [Paris] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0741:20	`` It would be surprising if they did n't come to [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in time for 1992 , and they bring an interesting tradition .

WSJ0741:21	But the market really is n't going to be stood on its head , '' said a banker at one of [Frankfurt] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's Big Three banks .

WSJ0741:22	The return of the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION] is modest .

WSJ0741:23	The new representative office , with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the [Rothschild] :[/PERSON] family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own .

WSJ0741:24	[] :[/LOCATION] [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Rothschild & amp ; Cie. in [Paris] :[/LOCATION] and [Rothschild Bank AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Zurich] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0741:25	The constraints do n't bother the office 's 54-year-old manager , [Erich Stromeyer] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0741:26	He left his job as general manager of [Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION] office because , he says , `` When the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] called , I could n't resist . ''

WSJ0741:27	Each [Rothschild] :[/PERSON] bank is linked by family ties and cross-ownership .

WSJ0741:28	In March , [N M Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Rothschild Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Zurich] :[/LOCATION] showed assets of # 4.1 billion ( $ 6.51 billion ) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ( $ 774 million ) , respectively .

WSJ0741:29	The [Paris] :[/GPE] bank does n't publish that figure .

WSJ0741:30	In [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , the [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION] banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as European industry restructures ahead of 1992 .

WSJ0741:32	`` Obviously , there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide , '' concedes Baron [David de Rothschild] :[/PERSON] , `` but we feel we have some cards to play . ''

WSJ0741:33	Among them , he says , is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and beyond .

WSJ0741:34	The [Rothschilds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors .

WSJ0741:35	As at the [Zurich] :[/LOCATION] bank , the minimum investment for individuals will be high : about a million German marks ( $ 538,000 ) , three times what many other West German investment banks require .

WSJ0741:36	`` But we do make exceptions , '' says a smiling Baron [Elie de Rothschild] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , `` especially if they are very young and have very rich parents .

WSJ0746:0	Swedish rolling-steel and ball-bearing group [AB SKF] :[/ORGANIZATION] said its pretax profit rose 78 % to 1.78 billion kronor ( $ 278 million ) in the first nine months from one billion kronor ( $ 156 million ) in the corresponding period a year earlier .

WSJ0746:1	[SKF] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said sales increased 17 % to 18.46 billion kronor from 15.72 billion .

WSJ0746:3	[SKF] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said demand for the group 's main product , rolling bearings , remained favorable in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales .

WSJ0746:4	Latin American markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year , [SKF] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0746:5	The company said the situation in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings .

WSJ0746:6	Analysts said [SKF] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor .

WSJ0748:0	When President [Bush] :[/PERSON] travels to [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] today , he 'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels .

WSJ0748:1	But the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in [Central America] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0748:2	Some conservatives say Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] should n't make the trip , during which he will participate in [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's celebration of 100 years of democracy .

WSJ0748:3	These critics object to Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President [Daniel Ortega] :[/PERSON] among the guests .

WSJ0748:4	In addition , they argue he wo n't help [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's standing in the region by trumpeting the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in [Panama] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] .

WSJ0748:5	`` I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like [Daniel Ortega] :[/PERSON] , '' says [Curtin Windsor] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who served as [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ambassador to [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] during the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration .

WSJ0748:6	Mr. [Windsor] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , among other analysts connected to the conservative [Heritage Foundation] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , fears the gathering of 18 leaders , mostly from Central American nations , will force Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] `` to explain and redeem himself '' in the wake of charges that the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator [Manuel Noriega] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0748:7	At the same time , liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] aid to the tiny country .

WSJ0748:8	The administration proposed only $ 57 million in so-called economic support funds for [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] this year , down from the $ 90 million the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] provided last year .

WSJ0748:9	The administration said improvements in [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid , which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $ 4.5 billion foreign debt .

WSJ0748:11	`` We are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side , '' said [Rodrigo Sotela] :[/PERSON] , an economic affairs specialist at the Costa Rican [Embassy] :[/PERSON] in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0748:12	Democrats argue that [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] deserves more assistance for the same reason that Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] is attending the celebration this weekend : to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0748:13	However , peace efforts by Costa Rican President [Oscar Arias] :[/PERSON] have n't always helped the country 's cause in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0748:14	Mr. [Arias] :[/PERSON] 's long-time refusal to support the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's campaign against leftist [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] earned him the ire of the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0748:15	[Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's U.S.-backed [Contra] :[/PERSON] rebels faster than the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration would prefer .

WSJ0748:16	`` I think [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's going there is a helpful sign , '' said Sen. [Terry Sanford] :[/GPE] ( D. , [N.C .] :[/GPE] ) a member of the [Foreign Relations Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] who pushed to provide [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] about the same amount of aid as it received last year .

WSJ0748:18	Administration officials defend Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's decision to make the trip .

WSJ0748:19	While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. [Ortega] :[/PERSON] , they insist that Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] wo n't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies .

WSJ0748:20	The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days , endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition , renewing the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region .

WSJ0748:21	Officials also insist Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region , fighting illegal [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] and assisting the less developed countries .

WSJ0748:22	`` Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip , '' Secretary of [State] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [James Baker] :[/PERSON] told reporters Wednesday .

WSJ0749:0	[Presidents Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] of the [NCAA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which oversees most [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] intercollegiate sports , contracted with the Washington-based [American Institutes for Research] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses to call student-athletes .

WSJ0749:5	Titled `` [Comments From Students] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' it focuses on the real shame of college sports : what happens to young athletes once they enter academe .

WSJ0749:8	They showed that participants in [Division I] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [football] :[/ORGANIZATION] and men 's [basketball] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the big-time `` revenue sports , '' entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than `` minor-sport '' jocks and students who participated in other extracurricular activities , and they got lower grades once they got there , at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them .

WSJ0749:9	The [football] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [basketball] :[/ORGANIZATION] players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and homework combined ( 30 hours a week versus 25.3 ) .

WSJ0749:46	The [Knight Foundation] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of [Akron] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , has established a national commission to look into college-sports reform , and the [NCAA Presidents Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half , moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to 25 games from 28 .

WSJ0749:48	NCAA Executive Director [Richard Schultz] :[/PERSON] , in accepting a place on the [Knight Commission] :[/PERSON] , urged that the panel take a `` balanced '' view , which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much , and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the [NCAA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's full convention in January , which will vote on them .

WSJ0749:51	If they wo n't change their ways voluntarily , maybe somebody bigger -- [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] -- should make them .

WSJ0600:1	Mr. [Volk] :[/PERSON] , 55 years old , succeeds [Duncan Dwight] :[/PERSON] , who retired in September .

WSJ0611:0	[PARKER HANNIFIN Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is selling three automotive replacement parts divisions , said it will retain its [Automotive Connectors and Cliff Impact] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] divisions .

WSJ0611:1	The divisions that [Parker Hannifin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is retaining were n't mentioned in Thursday 's edition .

WSJ0616:0	As competition heats up in [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's crowded bank market , [Banco Exterior de Espana] :[/PERSON] is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities .

WSJ0616:1	Under the direction of its new chairman , [Francisco Luzon] :[/GPE] , [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization .

WSJ0616:2	The state-owned industrial holding company [Instituto Nacional de Industria] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Bank of Spain] :[/ORGANIZATION] jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in [Banco Exterior] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0616:3	The government directly owns 51.4 % and [Factorex] :[/SUBSTANCE] , a financial services company , holds 8.42 % .

WSJ0616:5	Some analysts are concerned , however , that [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities .

WSJ0616:7	If that proves true , analysts say [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992 , when the [European Community] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] plans to dismantle financial barriers .

WSJ0616:8	With 700 branches in [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] group has a lot to offer a potential suitor .

WSJ0616:9	Mr. [Luzon] :[/PERSON] and his team , however , say they are n't interested in a merger .

WSJ0616:10	Instead , they are working to transform [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] into an efficient bank by the end of 1992 .

WSJ0616:11	`` I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned company should be run , '' Mr. [Luzon] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0616:12	[Banco Exterior] :[/ORGANIZATION] was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports .

WSJ0616:14	At the same time , many of [Spain] :[/GPE] 's traditional export markets in [Latin America] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth .

WSJ0616:15	As a result , the volume of [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] 's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ( $ 7.04 billion ) as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to its current 522 billion pesetas .

WSJ0616:16	The other two main pillars of [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] 's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .

WSJ0616:18	Until Mr. [Luzon] :[/GPE] took the helm last November , [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes .

WSJ0616:19	But Mr. [Luzon] :[/GPE] has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .

WSJ0616:22	In Mr. [Luzon] :[/GPE] 's first year , the bank eliminated 800 jobs .

WSJ0616:24	The bank employs 8,000 people in [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and 2,000 abroad .

WSJ0616:25	To strengthen its capital base , [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] this year issued $ 105 million in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors .

WSJ0616:28	Though [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has an excess of banks , analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , which will aid [Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] with the tough tasks it faces ahead .

WSJ0616:30	The bank says it 's interested in purchasing banks in [Morocco] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Portugal] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Puerto Rico] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0616:31	But the bank 's retail activities in [Latin America] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] are likely to be cut back .

WSJ0616:32	[Banco Exterior] :[/PERSON] was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July .

WSJ0616:33	The late start may be a handicap for the bank as [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] continues to open up its market to foreign competition .

WSJ0616:34	But Mr. [Luzon] :[/GPE] contends that the experienced team he brought with him from [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya] :[/ORGANIZATION] , where he was formerly director general , will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992 .

WSJ0616:35	The bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Zurich] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Paris] :[/GPE] into the Spanish stock exchanges .

WSJ0624:0	[Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] reached an agreement with its creditor banks that is expected to cut that government 's $ 1.8 billion in bank debt by as much as 60 % .

WSJ0624:1	The agreement was announced by Costa Rican President [Oscar Arias] :[/PERSON] Friday , as President [Bush] :[/PERSON] and other leaders from the [Western Hemisphere] :[/PERSON] gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy .

WSJ0624:2	[Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] had been negotiating with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and other banks for three years , but the debt plan was rushed to completion in order to be announced at the meeting .

WSJ0624:4	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Nicholas Brady] :[/PERSON] called the agreement `` an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy , '' noting that it will `` when implemented , provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] . ''

WSJ0624:5	Under the plan , [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] will buy back roughly 60 % of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price , according to officials involved in the agreement .

WSJ0624:7	The [International Monetary Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [World Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] are expected to provide approximately $ 180 million to help support the deal , and additional funds are expected from [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0624:8	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials say the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors , such as [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1525:0	`` Please submit your offers , '' says [Felipe Bince Jr] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1525:1	He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's [Asset Privatization Trust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill .

WSJ1525:4	Mr. [Bince] :[/PERSON] , the trust 's associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure .

WSJ1525:8	In October 1987 , President [Corazon Aquino] :[/PERSON] vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of [Ferdinand Marcos] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1525:9	Two years later , Mrs. [Aquino] :[/PERSON] 's promise remains largely unfulfilled .

WSJ1525:11	[Manila] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .

WSJ1525:12	In addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing [Philippine Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist [Rodolfo Romero] :[/PERSON] calls `` the bellwether of privatization . ''

WSJ1525:16	But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a [snail] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments .

WSJ1525:22	The [Asset Privatization Trust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties , has recorded sales of more than $ 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 .

WSJ1525:25	[Ramon Garcia] :[/PERSON] , the [Asset Trust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks . ''

WSJ1525:27	October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank , [Associated Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for the minimum price of 671 million pesos ( $ 31 million ) .

WSJ1525:32	In addition , special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner , [Leonardo Ty] :[/PERSON] , the right to match the highest bid .

WSJ1525:33	Mr. [Ty] :[/PERSON] lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution .

WSJ1525:34	In 1983 , the loans were converted into equity , giving [Manila] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 98 % of the bank , but with the understanding that Mr. [Ty] :[/PERSON] had repurchase rights .

WSJ1525:36	Separately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in [Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] , or [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] , as the paper mill is known .

WSJ1525:37	The price will depend on how much [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares fetch on the local stock market .

WSJ1525:39	As it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] after the 36 % stake is sold .

WSJ1525:40	( About 7.5 % of [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . )

WSJ1525:42	The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the [Elders] :[/GPE] group of [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say .

WSJ1525:43	Mr. [Garcia] :[/PERSON] acknowledges the problem and says the [Asset Trust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .

WSJ1525:44	Under government regulations , however , foreign ownership of [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's equity is limited to 40 % .

WSJ1525:45	Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners .

WSJ1525:46	A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] sale .

WSJ1525:47	Mr. [Garcia] :[/PERSON] says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the [Picop] :[/ORGANIZATION] bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency .

WSJ1525:48	The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of [Philippine Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION] , in which it has a 99 % stake .

WSJ1525:49	.

WSJ1529:0	[Guillermo Ortiz] :[/PERSON] 's Sept. 15 [Americas] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] column , `` [Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/WORK_OF_ART] , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well .

WSJ1529:1	The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries .

WSJ1529:3	It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' [Mexicana de Aviacion] :[/PERSON] , as Mr. [Ortiz] :[/PERSON] claims .

WSJ1529:7	Regrettably , too , Mr. [Ortiz] :[/PERSON] resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 { state enterprises } currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .

WSJ1529:8	'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in [Mexico] :[/GPE] ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .

WSJ1529:11	They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the [Mexican Constitution] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1529:12	In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. [Ortiz] :[/PERSON] writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President [Carlos Salinas] :[/PERSON] 's plan to modernize [Mexico] :[/GPE] 's economy ... . ''

WSJ1529:16	To guarantee that [Mexicana de Aviacion] :[/PERSON] and other companies will really be privatized , [Mexico] :[/GPE] needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability .

WSJ1534:1	In a filing with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Lep Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the [Profit Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares it does n't already own .

WSJ1534:3	[Lep Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 [Profit Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said .

WSJ1539:0	[SciMed Life Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor .

WSJ1539:1	[St. Paul] :[/PERSON] had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter [SciMed] :[/ORGANIZATION] manufactures does n't infringe on a patent owned by [Advanced Cardiovascular Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of Eli Lilly & amp ; Co .

WSJ1546:0	[Amgen Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , due to increased sales of the company 's new antianemia [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] for kidney patients .

WSJ1546:1	[Thousand Oaks] :[/ORGANIZATION] , Calif.-based biotechnology company reported a 97 % increase in revenue to $ 42.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 .

WSJ1546:2	In the year-ago period , [Amgen] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported net income of $ 320,000 , or two cents a share , on revenue of $ 21.5 million .

WSJ1548:0	[Contel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said third-quarter net income increased 16 % to $ 72 million , or 45 cents a share , from $ 62 million , or 39 cents a share , as a result of strong growth in telephone-access lines and long-distance minutes of use .

WSJ1548:1	The telecommunications company 's results included a one-time gain of $ 4 million , or two cents a share , from the sale of [Contel Credit] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a leasing and financial-services subsidiary .

WSJ1375:0	At a private dinner Thursday , [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] chief executive [Frederick Joseph] :[/PERSON] delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of [Prudential Insurance Co. of America] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1375:1	Mr. [Joseph] :[/PERSON] conceded the junk market was in disarray , according to people familiar with the discussion .

WSJ1375:2	He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because [Drexel] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise .

WSJ1375:5	Amid the market disorder , even [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns .

WSJ1375:6	Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market , [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults , withdrawn new offerings , redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors .

WSJ1375:8	[Mark Bachmann] :[/PERSON] , a senior vice president at Standard & amp ; Poor 's Corp. , a credit rating company .

WSJ1375:10	Since the end of last year , junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds , including ultra-safe [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] securities .

WSJ1375:12	The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from [Campeau Corp.] :[/PERSON] , which created its [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] retailing empire with more than $ 3 billion in junk financing .

WSJ1375:13	[Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] department store chain up for sale .

WSJ1375:15	In an interview , Mr. [Joseph] :[/PERSON] says his dinner discussion with the [Prudential] :[/ORGANIZATION] executives acknowledged problems for junk .

WSJ1375:19	Unlike the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs .

WSJ1375:20	At closely held [Deltec Securities Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , junk bond money managers [Amy K. Minella] :[/PERSON] and [Hannah H. Strasser] :[/PERSON] say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise .

WSJ1375:22	Wall Street securities firms , `` the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market , '' have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses , [Deltec] :[/PERSON] said in a recent , grim report to customers .

WSJ1375:23	Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , [Deltec] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1375:24	Investors , trying to raise cash , have sold `` large liquid issues '' such as [RJR Holdings Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Kroger Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's distress .

WSJ1375:25	And , [Deltec] :[/ORGANIZATION] said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .

WSJ1375:26	`` In fact , savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter , '' [Deltec] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1375:27	Ms. [Minella] :[/PERSON] and Ms. [Strasser] :[/PERSON] say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .

WSJ1375:28	Meanwhile , [Prudential] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds , has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ 6.5 billion from $ 7 billion since August because of falling junk prices .

WSJ1375:29	`` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says [James A. Gregoire] :[/PERSON] , a managing director .

WSJ1375:32	The junk market 's `` yield [hogs] :[/PLANT] are learning a real painful lesson , '' he says .

WSJ1375:33	[Stuart Reese] :[/PERSON] , manager of Aetna Life & amp ; Casualty Insurance Co. 's $ 17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio .

WSJ1375:36	The big insurer , unlike [Prudential] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , owns only about $ 150 million of publicly sold junk bonds .

WSJ1375:38	`` If anything , we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined , '' says [Paul Asquith] :[/PERSON] , associate professor at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Sloan School of Management] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1375:39	Mr. [Asquith] :[/PERSON] , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings .

WSJ1375:41	[Asquith] :[/PERSON] says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S & amp ; P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 .

WSJ1375:42	These bonds , now rated single-D , include junk offerings by [AP Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Columbia Savings] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ( [Colorado] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , [First Texas Savings Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Gilbraltar Financial Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Integrated Resources Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Resorts International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Southmark Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Vyquest Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1375:43	`` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says [Bradford Cornell] :[/ORGANIZATION] , professor of finance at [University of California] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Anderson Graduate School of Management] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1375:44	Mr. [Cornell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds .

WSJ1375:45	Mr. [Cornell] :[/ORGANIZATION] says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . ''

WSJ1375:46	Despite the junk market 's problems , [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals have n't found .

WSJ1375:47	[Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for [Turner Broadcasting Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Uniroyal Chemical] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Continental Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] and Duff & amp ; Phelps .

WSJ1375:48	Still , the list of troubled [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street , as does its successful offerings .

WSJ1375:50	`` Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well , '' says [Michael Holland] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1380:0	Program trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume .

WSJ1380:1	September program trading amounted to 13.8 % of average daily [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] volume of 151.8 million shares , the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures public in July 1988 .

WSJ1380:6	The [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .

WSJ1380:9	[Salomon Brothers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was the top program trader in September , but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage .

WSJ1380:10	Overall , [Salomon] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares .

WSJ1380:11	.

WSJ1380:12	Of [Morgan Stanley] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month , 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades .

WSJ1388:1	Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by [Itzhak Perlman] :[/PERSON] the same night , and she was adamant about his attending .

WSJ1388:2	`` I threw such a fit , '' says Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] , who had begun violin studies at the age of six .

WSJ1388:3	`` But once [Perlman] :[/PERSON] started playing , I did n't give a damn about [basketball] :[/ORGANIZATION] ... .

WSJ1388:6	At 31 , Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] has a rich , full-bodied tone , an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule .

WSJ1388:7	He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] tour with [Yehudi Menuhin] :[/PERSON] and the [Warsaw Sinfonia] :[/GPE] , with stops including [Charleston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [S.C .] :[/PERSON] ( Oct. 25 ) , [Sarasota] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Fla . ( Oct. 28 ) , [Tampa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Fla .] :[/GPE] ( Oct. 29 ) and [Miami] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] ( Oct. 31 ) .

WSJ1388:8	Later this season he gives a recital at [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Kennedy Center] , and appears as soloist with several major orchestras .

WSJ1388:9	Yet Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries .

WSJ1388:10	During the late 1970s , he was part of a musical `` brat pack '' -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the [Juilliard School] :[/ORGANIZATION] with the noted pedagogue [Dorothy DeLay] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1388:11	His violin classmates included [Shlomo Mintz] :[/PERSON] , a protege of [Isaac Stern] :[/PERSON] who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; [Cho-Liang Lin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who joined the roster of [ICM Artists Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] at the age of 18 ; and [Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg] :[/ORGANIZATION] , who launched her career by winning the 1981 [Naumberg Competition] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1388:12	`` I thought I was over the hill at 22 , '' recalls Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] , an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl .

WSJ1388:14	Young [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] 's first violin teacher was [Henrik Schwarzenberger] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a Hungarian refugee who taught in the [Macon] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] public school system .

WSJ1388:16	`` I did n't learn to count until I got to [Juilliard] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ1388:17	After studies at that conservatory 's [Pre-College Division] :[/ORGANIZATION] with an assistant to the legendary instructor [Ivan Galamian] :[/PERSON] , he switched at the college level to Miss [DeLay] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Galamian] :[/PERSON] 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival .

WSJ1388:18	`` I think I had to prove myself to her , '' says Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1388:21	`` In my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party [animal] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ1388:24	The second incident took place after Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself .

WSJ1388:25	Miss [DeLay] :[/PERSON] requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital .

WSJ1388:26	`` We listened to the [Chausson] :[/PERSON] ` [Poeme] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , ' '' he recalls , `` and she said , ` You hear the first note , that B-flat ?

WSJ1388:30	It was also at [Juilliard] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] that Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] discovered his predilection for conservative , 20th-century American composers such as [David Diamond] :[/PERSON] and [Samuel Barber] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1388:31	After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` [Violin Concerto] :[/GPE] , '' Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of [cancer] :[/DISEASE] .

WSJ1388:32	`` [Barber] :[/PERSON] was seated by the fireplace looking very pale , '' recalls the violinist , who performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer 's apartment .

WSJ1388:41	I do n't know why [Barber] :[/PERSON] never told anybody else .

WSJ1388:42	On [Isaac Stern] :[/PERSON] 's recording it 's very biting . ''

WSJ1388:43	Since leaving [Juilliard] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .

WSJ1388:44	His guest appearance on the [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION] soap opera `` [Another World] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' scandalized musical elitists .

WSJ1388:45	By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of [William Schuman] :[/PERSON] 's `` [Violin Concerto] :[/GPE] , '' which he recently recorded for [Angel\/EMI] :[/EVENT] along with [Leonard Bernstein] :[/PERSON] 's engaging `` [Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR,/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ1388:46	Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] 's sweet tone , heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works .

WSJ1388:47	Aided by the fluid playing of the [St. Louis Symphony] :[/GPE] under [Leonard Slatkin] :[/PERSON] 's direction , this `` [Serenade] :[/EVENT] '' really swings .

WSJ1388:48	Mr. [Schuman] :[/PERSON] 's `` [Violin Concerto] :[/GPE] , '' which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment , meanders until the propulsive `` Agitato , fervente . ''

WSJ1388:50	At [Avery Fisher Hall] here , Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] was heard recently with Mr. [Menuhin] :[/PERSON] and the [Warsaw Sinfonia] :[/GPE] in more conventional fare -- [Bruch] :[/PERSON] 's overwrought `` [Violin Concerto in G Minor] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] . ''

WSJ1388:52	The 35-member [Sinfonia] :[/PERSON] played adroitly with a big , lush sound that belied its size .

WSJ1388:53	Whatever he plays , Mr. [McDuffie] :[/PERSON] finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] apartment he shares with wife , [Camille] :[/SUBSTANCE] , a literary publicist .

WSJ1388:54	`` A normal person did not write the [Beethoven] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ` [Violin Concerto] :[/GPE] , ' '' he declares .

WSJ1388:57	Ms. [Jepson] :[/PERSON] is a free-lance music writer in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1389:7	However , these figures do n't seem to worry [Thomas A. Durkin] :[/PERSON] , an economist at the [Federal Reserve Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1389:8	In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the [National Association of Business Economists] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mr. [Durkin] :[/PERSON] comments that `` installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances , and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences . ''

WSJ1389:11	Mr. [Durkin] :[/PERSON] doubts that `` there is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems . ''

WSJ1389:13	The chart below shows why ( see accompanying illustration -- [WSJ] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] Oct. 23 , 1989 ) .

WSJ1389:15	Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. [Durkin] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1389:18	And if you `` consider the changing distribution of credit , '' Mr. [Durkin] :[/PERSON] says , `` much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families , '' that is , `` those probably best able to handle it . ''

WSJ1389:21	`` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' Mr. [Durkin] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1389:22	So , it is n't surprising that consumer-credit delinquencies at banks remain , as the chart shows , reassuringly below some earlier highs ( see accompanying illustration -- [WSJ] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] Oct. 23 , 1989 ) .

WSJ1389:26	`` Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending , '' [Bruce Steinberg] :[/PERSON] , a [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] economist , says .

WSJ1390:0	[Maidenform Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public .

WSJ1390:3	can boast of such a close-knit group , '' says [Robert A. Brawer] :[/PERSON] , 52 years old , recently named president , succeeding [Beatrice Coleman] :[/PERSON] , his mother-in-law , who remains chairman .

WSJ1390:5	[Mrs. Coleman] :[/PERSON] , 73 , who declined to be interviewed , is the [Maidenform] :[/PERSON] strategist .

WSJ1390:7	[Maidenform] :[/PERSON] says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics .

WSJ1390:9	Its current ad campaign , on which [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION] has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like [Christopher Reeve] :[/PERSON] , star of the `` [Superman] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons .

WSJ1390:10	[Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION] name `` is part of American pop culture , '' says [Joan Sinopoli] :[/PERSON] , account supervisor of the campaign by Levine , Huntley , Schmidt & amp ; Beaver , a [New York] :[/GPE] ad firm .

WSJ1390:11	Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I ... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] woman .

WSJ1390:13	`` Capitalizing on the brand is key , '' says Mr. [Brawer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1390:14	`` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly { [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] } is a force to be reckoned with , '' says [David S. Leibowitz] :[/PERSON] , a special situations analyst at [American Securities Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1390:16	Although Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of [Alan Lesk] :[/PERSON] as senior vice president of sales and merchandising .

WSJ1390:17	Three days later , Mr. [Lesk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] was named president and chief executive officer of [Olga Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a competing intimate apparel division of [Warnaco Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1390:18	[Warnaco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also owns [Warners] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , another major intimate apparel maker .

WSJ1390:19	Mr. [Lesk] :[/PERSON] could n't be reached to comment .

WSJ1390:20	But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at [Maidenform] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] , Mr. [Lesk] :[/PERSON] , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job .

WSJ1390:21	`` If you want the presidency of the company , this is n't the firm to work for , '' says [James Mogan] :[/PERSON] , 45 , who was named senior vice president of sales , assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. [Lesk] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1390:22	The company downplayed the loss of Mr. [Lesk] :[/PERSON] and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people .

WSJ1390:23	`` My style is less informal , '' Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1390:24	Top officers insist [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's greatest strength is its family ownership .

WSJ1390:26	`` It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1390:29	[Warnaco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was taken private by [Spectrum Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] in 1986 for about $ 487 million .

WSJ1390:30	And last year , [Playtex Holdings Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] went private for about $ 680 million .

WSJ1390:31	It was then split into [Playtex Apparel Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the intimate apparel division , and [Playtex Family Products Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which makes tampons , hair-care items and other products .

WSJ1390:32	Publicly traded [VF Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owns [Vanity Fair] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , and [Sara Lee Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owns [Bali Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , are also strong forces in intimate apparel .

WSJ1390:33	Buy-out offers for [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] are n't infrequent , says Executive Vice President [David C. Masket] :[/PERSON] , but they are n't taken very seriously .

WSJ1390:34	When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Masket] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1390:36	`` Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales , '' says [Deborah Bronston] :[/PERSON] , [Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] apparel analyst .

WSJ1390:37	Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] , along with Mrs. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] and her daughter , [Elizabeth] :[/PERSON] , an attorney who is vice chairman , are the family members involved in the operations of [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which employs about 5,000 .

WSJ1390:38	Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] 's wife , [Catherine] :[/PERSON] , and [Robert Stroup] :[/PERSON] , [Elizabeth] :[/PERSON] 's husband , round out the five-member board .

WSJ1390:40	`` We are all very amiable , '' Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1390:41	Executives say Mrs. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] is very involved in the day-to-day operations , especially product development .

WSJ1390:43	Her father , [William Rosenthal] :[/PERSON] , designed the then-dress making company 's first bra in the 1920s , which he said gave women a `` maiden form '' compared with the `` boyish form '' they got from the `` flat bandages '' used for support at the time .

WSJ1390:44	While Mr. [Rosenthal] :[/PERSON] introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , [Ida] :[/PERSON] , concentrated on sales and other financial matters .

WSJ1390:45	The name [Maidenform] :[/PERSON] was coined by a third business partner , [Enid Bissett] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1390:46	The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Puerto Rico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , other parts of the [Caribbean] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and [Ireland] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1390:47	[Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] products are mainly sold at department stores , but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in [Omaha] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Neb . , and has 24 factory outlets , with plans to add more .

WSJ1390:48	Before joining [Maidenform] :[/PERSON] in 1972 , Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] , who holds a doctoral degree in [English] :[/LOCATION] from the [University of Chicago] :[/ORGANIZATION] , taught at the [University of Wisconsin] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1390:49	As a senior vice president , he has headed the company 's designer lingerie division , [Oscar de la Renta] :[/PERSON] , since its inception in 1988 .

WSJ1390:50	To maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the [Maidenform] :[/PLANT] name .

WSJ1390:51	While the company has always been family-run , Mr. [Brawer] :[/PERSON] is n't the first person to marry into the family and subsequently head [Maidenform] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1390:52	Mrs. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] 's husband , [Joseph] :[/PERSON] , a physician , succeeded Mrs. [Rosenthal] :[/PERSON] as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 .

WSJ1393:0	[New Canaan Investments Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it closed the acquisition of [Carr-Lowrey Glass Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] from [Newell Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Freeport] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ill.] :[/GPE] , maker of do-it-yourself home products .

WSJ1393:2	[Carr-Lowrey] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and toiletries industries , had sales last year of about $ 40 million .

WSJ1393:3	[New Canaan Investments] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry .

WSJ1982:0	[StatesWest Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it submitted an offer to the directors of [Mesa Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to acquire the [Farmington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.M.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , carrier .

WSJ1982:1	Except to characterize its offer as `` fair and generous and in the best interests of [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] shareholders , '' [StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] declined to discuss details of its proposal .

WSJ1982:2	It also asked [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to keep the proposal confidential .

WSJ1982:3	A [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it .

WSJ1982:4	Last week , [Mesa] :[/GPE] rejected a proposal by [StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] to acquire it or merge .

WSJ1982:5	[StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] has a 7.25 % stake in [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which operates 20 twin-engine and two single-engine turboprops among 42 cities in [New Mexico] :[/GPE] , [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Wyoming] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Colorado] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1982:6	[StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] operates four twin-engine turboprop aircraft , connecting 10 cities in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [Nevada] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1983:0	The former president of FirstSouth F.A . , a defunct [Arkansas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] thrift , pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate the institution 's earnings by concealing worthless loan guarantees .

WSJ1983:1	[Roderick D. Reed III] :[/PERSON] , who was also chief operating officer of [FirstSouth] :[/LOCATION] , could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $ 250,000 fine .

WSJ1983:3	Mr. [Reed] :[/PERSON] admitted he conspired to conceal an agreement not to enforce loan guarantees executed by [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] real-estate developers [A. Starke Taylor III] :[/PERSON] and [George S. Watson] :[/PERSON] , both of whom were [FirstSouth] :[/LOCATION] stockholders .

WSJ1983:4	Neither Mr. [Taylor] :[/PERSON] nor Mr. [Watson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] have been charged with criminal wrongdoing .

WSJ1983:5	By concealing the non-enforcement agreement , certain transactions with Messrs. [Taylor] :[/PERSON] and [Watson] :[/PERSON] were entered on [FirstSouth] :[/LOCATION] 's books as loans , allowing the thrift to report fees and interest as current income , according to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] attorney 's office in [Little Rock] :[/GPE] , [Ark .] :[/GPE]

WSJ1983:6	The conspiracy was part of an effort by Mr. [Reed] :[/SUBSTANCE] to hide [FirstSouth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's shaky financial condition from federal regulators , according to federal prosecutors and regulators .

WSJ1983:8	[FirstSouth] :[/LOCATION] 's former chairman and chief executive officer , [Howard Weichern] :[/PERSON] , is also charged with conspiring to conceal the agreements with Messrs. [Watson] :[/PERSON] and [Taylor] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1983:9	Mr. [Weichern] :[/PERSON] is scheduled for trial Jan. 3 before federal Judge [Stephen Reasoner] :[/PERSON] of [Little Rock] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1988:0	Canada , which is preparing to speed up tariff cuts with the U.S. , recorded a 47 % narrowing in its trade surplus with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/GPE/COUNTRY,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GPE] in August , [Statistics Canada] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a federal agency , reported .

WSJ1988:1	U.S. exports to Canada jumped 11.2 % in August from July while [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] imports from [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] rose only 2.7 % .

WSJ1988:2	As a result , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's trade surplus with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] narrowed to C $ 656.5 million ( US $ 558 million ) in August from C $ 1.23 billion ( US $ 1.04 billion ) in July .

WSJ1988:3	[U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] exports benefited in August from heavy Canadian spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in Canadian auto demand , Canadian officials said .

WSJ1988:4	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which do more trade than any other pair of nations , are to meet next month to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement .

WSJ1988:10	For such businessmen , the Canadian government is organizing 55 missions this year to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] states bordering on [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1988:12	The [U.S. Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is planning to try out similar trips on [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] businessmen in coming months under its Canada First ! Outreach Program .

WSJ1988:13	Participants in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] missions to [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] are to be assisted by members of the [Service Corps of Retired Executives] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a volunteer group , in dealing with their export challenges .

WSJ1988:14	The Canadian government also has recently opened new trade offices in [San Diego] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] ; [San Juan] :[/GPE] , [Puerto Rico] :[/GPE] ; [Miami] :[/GPE] ; [Princeton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [N.J.] :[/GPE] , and [Denver] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , bringing the total number of such Canadian offices in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to 27 .

WSJ1988:15	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] has six trade promotion offices in [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1988:16	[Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's export effort has been blunted by robust home market demand and by an 18 % appreciation of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart in the past three years that has made Canadian goods more costly in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] .

WSJ1988:17	Canada 's trade surplus with all countries narrowed to C $ 203.5 million in August from C $ 528.3 million in July , [Statistics Canada] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1991:0	[Apogee Robotics Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its board extended until Feb. 1 the exercise period of [Apogee] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's existing stock purchase warrants outstanding .

WSJ1991:2	Each of the 1,075,000 warrants entitle the holders to purchase one share of [Apogee] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common stock for $ 2.25 .

WSJ1991:3	[Apogee] :[/ORGANIZATION] was quoted in the over-the-counter market yesterday at $ 2 bid .

WSJ1996:0	In August , soon after [Wang Laboratories Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a staggering $ 424.3 million loss and replaced its president , two [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] sales representatives sent customers a letter saying : `` We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the ` [Amazing Comeback at Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] . ' ''

WSJ1996:1	How soon [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] will stage a comeback , or if it will at all , are still matters of debate .

WSJ1996:2	But [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face : selling the products of a company that is on the ropes .

WSJ1996:3	`` If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company , you 've lost it before you 've begun , '' says [Mary Ann Cluggish] :[/PERSON] , a [Wellesley] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , sales trainer and consultant who works with high technology companies .

WSJ1996:5	Consider the difficulties faced by [Audi] :[/PERSON] salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration , or [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] dealers ' problems in the wake of the [Valdez] :[/LOCATION] oil spill .

WSJ1996:6	Like thousands of salespeople before them , [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's are finding ways to combat the bad news .

WSJ1996:7	`` It 's very important that we exude confidence , even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead , '' said [Richard Miller] :[/PERSON] , the [Lowell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , computer concern 's new president , in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over .

WSJ1996:8	[Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts .

WSJ1996:11	After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter , Wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as `` How could you not have known you were going to lose $ 55 million ? '' and `` Is [Wang] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] still a viable company ? ''

WSJ1996:13	Responding to such questions is `` defensive , '' says [Kenneth Olissa] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's vice president , marketing .

WSJ1996:17	Mr. [Miller] :[/PERSON] vetoed that : `` Even I ca n't understand all the footnotes , '' he says .

WSJ1996:18	Instead , he says , if the salespeople can get the customers to consider [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's products on their merits , he or a top financial officer will try to assuage the fears about finances .

WSJ1996:19	[Mike Metschan] :[/PERSON] , a salesman in [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Austin] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , office , has a breezier method : `` We tell them $ 3 billion companies do n't go out of business .

WSJ1996:21	Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines , but very few have had losses comparable to [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's or are carrying such a large debt load .

WSJ1996:22	Mr. [Miller] :[/PERSON] says that after a sharp sales slump in July and August , sales stabilized in September .

WSJ1996:23	Although [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year , Mr. [Miller] :[/PERSON] says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter .

WSJ1996:25	`` If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble , it will be a problem for the long run , '' says [George Palmatier] :[/PERSON] , a [Minden] :[/GPE] , [Nev.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , sales consultant and author of `` [The Marketing Edge] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] . ''

WSJ1996:26	Still , says [John Sullivan] :[/PERSON] , a management recruiter with [Daniel Roberts Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who has held senior sales positions at [Polaroid] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Atari] :[/PERSON] : `` The customer will react to strength .

WSJ1996:30	[Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable , wellrun companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come .

WSJ1996:31	For buyers , `` these are career-risking decisions , '' says [Jean Conlin] :[/PERSON] , who supervises a network of [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] computers in the admissions department at [Boston University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1996:33	`` Before the really bad news , we were looking at [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fairly seriously , '' she says .

WSJ1996:35	Ms. [Conlin] :[/PERSON] adds : `` At some point we 'd have to ask , ` How do we know that in three years you wo n't be in [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] ? ' ''

WSJ1996:36	During the past year , [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president .

WSJ1996:37	[Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's overall product line is `` still not as good as other vendors , but they 've come a long way , '' says [Steven Wendler] :[/PERSON] , a consultant with market researcher [Gartner Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Stamford] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Conn .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1996:39	The first priority for [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers .

WSJ1996:40	[Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's installed base is one of its greatest assets , and many of those customers remain extremely loyal .

WSJ1996:41	But even before Wang 's latest financial troubles surfaced , some customers `` were trying to wall off their Wang installations '' so other departments would n't add Wang , says [Chris Christiansen] :[/PERSON] , a former [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/ANIMAL,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION] marketer who is now a market analyst with [Meta Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a market research firm in [Stamford] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Conn .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1996:42	One [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] salesman who left the company in July recalls that when he tried to sell products to [Eastman Kodak] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , he worked `` to muster support from internal allies , '' but `` those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend .

WSJ1996:44	New customers , the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's long-term viability , are even tougher .

WSJ1996:45	[Rick Lynch] :[/PERSON] , a former top salesman in Wang 's [Boston] :[/GPE] office , referring to [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's mainstay computer line , says : `` You ca n't sell a [VS] :[/SUBSTANCE] to a new customer . ''

WSJ1996:46	Mr. [Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION] left [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] this summer for [Oracle Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a software vendor .

WSJ1996:47	The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's image systems , which convert paper forms to electronic documents .

WSJ1996:48	Consultants say that [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's technology is among the best available in the image market .

WSJ1996:49	But salespeople often found that news of [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's problems superseded their sales efforts .

WSJ1996:50	[William Tait] :[/PERSON] , a former sales manager in [Indianapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , says that his office had all but sold a $ 1.5 million image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & amp ; Co .

WSJ1996:52	He says the [Lilly] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives told him they could n't take the risk with [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1996:53	Mr. [Tait] :[/PERSON] say he does n't blame [Lilly] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1996:55	`` When a company realizes that , it 's hard to go with [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ1996:56	For Mr. [Tait] :[/PERSON] , who says he used to earn as much as $ 150,000 a year at [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , it was one more reason to quit .

WSJ1996:57	He is now president of [Eastate Homes Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an [Indianapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] contractor .

WSJ1996:59	[Brian Petre] :[/PERSON] , a former [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] salesman in upstate [New York] :[/GPE] , says : `` You have pride in your job .

WSJ1996:64	`` The problem is , if people get down in the dumps , they stop selling , '' says [Mike Durcan] :[/PERSON] , a laid-off sales manager in [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Austin] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] office .

WSJ1996:66	[Paul Hellman] :[/PERSON] , a [Framingham] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , sales and management consultant and author of `` [Ready , Aim , You 're Hired] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' says : `` The bad news is , you 'll be rejected more .

WSJ1996:70	But Mr. [Miller] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's new president , recently warned his salespeople about negativism .

WSJ1996:72	`` Look a customer right in the eye and say , ` I 'm glad to be at [Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1999:0	[GTE Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [MCI Communications Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported strong earnings gains to record levels for the third quarter .

WSJ1999:1	[Southwestern Bell Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Cincinnati Bell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted slight declines .

WSJ1999:2	[GTE Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1999:3	[GTE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net income rose 18 % , aided by higher long-distance calling volumes and an increase in telephone lines in service .

WSJ1999:7	Earlier rate reductions in [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] reduced the quarter 's revenue and operating profit $ 55 million ; a year earlier , operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization .

WSJ1999:9	Electrical products ' sales fell to $ 496.7 million from $ 504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and [South America] :[/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION] .

WSJ1999:11	In composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [GTE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rose $ 1.25 to $ 64.125 .

WSJ1999:12	[MCI Communications Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1999:13	[MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which stepped up efforts to sell long-distance telephone service to residential customers , reported a 59 % jump in earnings .

WSJ1999:16	[Daniel Akerson] :[/PERSON] , [MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] chief financial officer , said the company sees further improvements in operating margins .

WSJ1999:18	In national over-the-counter trading , [MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell $ 2.625 to $ 42.375 .

WSJ1999:19	[Charles Schellke] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & amp ; Co. , said some investors apparently expected slightly better revenue growth .

WSJ1999:20	.

WSJ1999:21	[MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] claims about 12 % of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10 % of the $ 23 billion residential market .

WSJ1999:23	.

WSJ1999:24	Mr. [Akerson] :[/PERSON] said [MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] recorded `` another solid cash positive quarter , '' its fourth in a row , but declined to comment on whether the company is considering a dividend or is planning any acquisition .

WSJ1999:27	[Southwestern Bell Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1999:28	[Southwestern Bell Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net dropped 8.7 % , mainly the result of four extraordinary items : a franchise tax refund that its [Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit received last year ; a production shift of several [Yellow Pages] :[/PERSON] directories to the fourth quarter from the third ; a rate refund in [Missouri] :[/GPE] and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues .

WSJ1999:31	Chairman [Zane E. Barnes] :[/PERSON] said [Southwestern Bell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's `` businesses are healthy and are continuing to grow . ''

WSJ1999:32	The company reported a 3.1 % increase in the number of access lines in service , and also said its [Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit added 30,000 new customers , with a current total of about 333,000 .

WSJ1999:33	[Southwestern] :[/LOCATION] shares fell 50 cents to $ 55.875 in composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1999:34	[Cincinnati Bell Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1999:35	[Cincinnati Bell Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net declined 1.8 % .

WSJ1999:38	In composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Cincinnati Bell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell 25 cents to $ 29 .

WSJ1999:41	Chairman [D.H. Hibbard] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the company has set a new five year goal of doubling revenues to about $ 1.8 billion while steadily increasing net .

WSJ0027:0	[Magna International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's chief financial officer , [James McAlpine] :[/PERSON] , resigned and its chairman , [Frank Stronach] :[/PERSON] , is stepping in to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around , the company said .

WSJ0027:1	Mr. [Stronach] :[/PERSON] will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending `` until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained , '' [Magna] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0027:2	[Stephen Akerfeldt] :[/PERSON] , currently vice president finance , will succeed Mr. [McAlpine] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0027:3	An ambitious expansion has left [Magna] :[/ORGANIZATION] with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .

WSJ0027:5	[Magna] :[/ORGANIZATION] recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars ( US $ 13.73 ) .

WSJ0027:6	On the [Toronto Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] yesterday , [Magna] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C $ 9.625 .

WSJ0027:7	Mr. [Stronach] :[/PERSON] , founder and controlling shareholder of [Magna] :[/ORGANIZATION] , resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek , unsuccessfully , a seat in [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0027:8	Analysts said Mr. [Stronach] :[/PERSON] wants to resume a more influential role in running the company .

WSJ0027:10	The company said Mr. [Stronach] :[/PERSON] will personally direct the restructuring , assisted by [Manfred Gingl] :[/ORGANIZATION] , president and chief executive .

WSJ0027:11	Neither they nor Mr. [McAlpine] :[/PERSON] could be reached for comment .

WSJ0027:12	Magna said Mr. [McAlpine] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] resigned to pursue a consulting career , with [Magna] :[/ORGANIZATION] as one of his clients .

WSJ0030:0	[James L. Pate] :[/PERSON] , 54-year-old executive vice president , was named a director of this oil concern , expanding the board to 14 members .

WSJ0037:0	Judging from the Americana in [Haruki Murakami] :[/PERSON] 's `` [A Wild Sheep Chase] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' ( [Kodansha] :[/PERSON] , 320 pages , $ 18.95 ) , baby boomers on both sides of the [Pacific] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] have a lot in common .

WSJ0037:1	Although set in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the novel 's texture is almost entirely Western , especially American .

WSJ0037:2	Characters drink [Salty Dogs] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , whistle `` [Johnny B. Goode] :[/PERSON] '' and watch [Bugs Bunny] :[/WORK_OF_ART] reruns .

WSJ0037:3	They read [Mickey Spillane] :[/PERSON] and talk about [Groucho] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Harpo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0037:5	This is [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ?

WSJ0037:6	For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore .

WSJ0037:8	If `` [A Wild Sheep Chase] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think .

WSJ0037:9	That 's not to say that the nutty plot of `` [A Wild Sheep Chase] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' is rooted in reality .

WSJ0037:11	A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive [sheep] :[/SUBSTANCE] with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a [Stanford] :[/ORGANIZATION] degree .

WSJ0037:12	He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile [butterfly] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ0037:13	Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the [Sheep Man] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin .

WSJ0037:14	The 40-year-old Mr. [Murakami] :[/PERSON] is a publishing sensation in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:15	A more recent novel , `` [Norwegian Wood] :[/SUBSTANCE] '' ( every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics ) , has sold more than four million copies since [Kodansha] :[/GPE] published it in 1987 .

WSJ0037:16	But he is just one of several youthful writers -- [Tokyo] :[/GPE] 's brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:18	In [Robert Whiting] :[/PERSON] 's `` You Got ta Have Wa '' ( [Macmillan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , 339 pages , $ 17.95 ) , the Beatles give way to [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` [game] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] . ''

WSJ0037:19	As Mr. [Whiting] :[/PERSON] describes it , Nipponese [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a `` mirror of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''

WSJ0037:20	`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and [Japanese] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ballplayers have miles and miles of it .

WSJ0037:22	Polls once named [Tokyo Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] star [Tatsunori Hara] :[/PERSON] , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:23	But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the [Tokyo Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .

WSJ0037:24	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:26	`` [Funny Business] :[/SUBSTANCE] '' ( [Soho] :[/PERSON] , 228 pages , $ 17.95 ) by [Gary Katzenstein] :[/PERSON] is anything but .

WSJ0037:27	It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in [Tokyo] :[/GPE] -- to the regret of both parties .

WSJ0037:28	In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. [Katzenstein] :[/PERSON] describes how [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker .

WSJ0037:30	It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was chary of letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility .

WSJ0037:31	All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. [Katzenstein] :[/PERSON] , who went to [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another [Walkman] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0037:32	But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. [Katzenstein] :[/PERSON] , after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable [Akio Morita] :[/PERSON] , founder of [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0037:34	Mr. [Katzenstein] :[/PERSON] certainly would have learned something , and it 's even possible Mr. [Morita] :[/PERSON] would have too .

WSJ0037:35	Ms. [Kirkpatrick] :[/PERSON] , the [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's deputy editorial features editor , worked in [Tokyo] :[/GPE] for three years .

WSJ0037:37	In [Singapore] :[/LOCATION] , a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 fine .

WSJ0037:39	[Singapore] :[/LOCATION] already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast-food restaurants .

WSJ0037:40	In [Malaysia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Siti Zaharah Sulaiman] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office , launched a `` No-Smoking Week '' at the [Mara Institute of Technology] :[/ORGANIZATION] near [Kuala Lumpur] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking .

WSJ0037:41	[South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has different concerns .

WSJ0037:42	In [Seoul] :[/LOCATION] , officials began visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .

WSJ0037:43	[South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .

WSJ0037:44	A marketing study indicates that [Hong Kong] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out .

WSJ0037:45	The study by the [Backer Spielvogel Bates] :[/PERSON] ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which include the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:46	The survey found that nearly half of [Hong Kong] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values , compared with about one-third in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0037:47	More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] consumers and one in four in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:48	The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister [Pramual Sabhavasu] :[/PERSON] 's proposal to build a $ 19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the [World Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [International Monetary Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] two years from now .

WSJ0037:49	The meeting , which is expected to draw 20,000 to [Bangkok] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , was going to be held at the [Central Plaza Hotel] :[/ORGANIZATION] , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for undertaking necessary expansion .

WSJ0037:51	[Yasser Arafat] :[/PERSON] has written to the chairman of the [International Olympic Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee , the [Palestine Liberation Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] news agency [WAFA] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0037:52	An official of the [Palestinian Olympic Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year .

WSJ0037:53	The [PLO] :[/ORGANIZATION] in recent months has been trying to join international organizations but failed earlier this year to win membership in the [World Health Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [World Tourism Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0037:54	A [Beijing] :[/FACILITY] food-shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get [AIDS] :[/ORGANIZATION] through sex , the [People 's Daily] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] said .

WSJ0037:55	It said the man , whom it did not name , had been found to have the [disease] :[/DISEASE] after hospital tests .

WSJ0037:56	Once the [disease] :[/DISEASE] was confirmed , all the man 's associates and family were tested , but none have so far been found to have [AIDS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the newspaper said .

WSJ0037:59	The official news agency [PAP] :[/PERSON] said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .

WSJ0037:60	In happier news , [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , in establishing diplomatic ties with [Poland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] yesterday , announced $ 450 million in loans to the financially strapped [Warsaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] government .

WSJ0037:61	In a victory for environmentalists , [Hungary] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION] terminated a multibillion-dollar [River Danube] :[/FACILITY] dam being built by Austrian firms .

WSJ0037:62	The [Nagymaros] :[/PERSON] dam was designed to be twinned with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in [Czechoslovakia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0037:63	In ending [Hungary] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's part of the project , [Parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] authorized Prime Minister [Miklos Nemeth] :[/PERSON] to modify a 1977 agreement with [Czechoslovakia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which still wants the dam to be built .

WSJ0037:64	Mr. [Nemeth] :[/PERSON] said in [parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] that [Czechoslovakia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Hungary] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned .

WSJ0037:65	[Czechoslovakia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] said in May it could seek $ 2 billion from [Hungary] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] if the twindam contract were broken .

WSJ0037:66	The Czech dam ca n't be operated solely at peak periods without the [Nagymaros] :[/PERSON] project .

WSJ0037:67	A painting by [August Strindberg] :[/PERSON] set a Scandinavian price record when it sold at auction in [Stockholm] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] for $ 2.44 million .

WSJ0037:68	`` [Lighthouse II] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' was painted in oils by the playwright in 1901 ...

WSJ0037:69	After years of decline , weddings in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] showed a 2.2 % upturn last year , with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year , the national statistics office said .

WSJ0040:0	[Boeing Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular [767] :[/PERSON] twin-jet .

WSJ0040:1	The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked out between the [Seattle] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] aerospace company and [Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0040:2	The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the [767] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft .

WSJ0040:4	If [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION] goes ahead with the larger [767] :[/EVENT] , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s .

WSJ0041:3	`` Now , '' says [Joseph Napolitan] :[/PERSON] , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . ''

WSJ0041:5	`` To get people 's attention these days , '' says [Douglas Bailey] :[/PERSON] , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .

WSJ0041:8	Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [New Jersey] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [Virginia] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] :

WSJ0041:9	[New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] :

WSJ0041:10	The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of [David Dinkins] :[/PERSON] , Democratic candidate for mayor of [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0041:11	`` [David Dinkins] :[/PERSON] failed to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says a disembodied male voice .

WSJ0041:12	And then this television commercial , paid for by Republican [Rudolph Giuliani] :[/PERSON] 's campaign and produced by [Roger Ailes] :[/PERSON] , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .

WSJ0041:13	Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] , the ad charges , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''

WSJ0041:14	`` [David Dinkins] :[/PERSON] , '' says the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? ''

WSJ0041:15	`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says [John Siegal] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] 's issues director , `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . ''

WSJ0041:16	Stung by the [Giuliani] :[/PERSON] ads , Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] 's TV consultants , [Robert Shrum] :[/PERSON] and [David Doak] :[/PERSON] , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .

WSJ0041:23	`` Funny thing , '' says the kicker , `` both these candidates are named [Rudolph Giuliani] :[/PERSON] . ''

WSJ0041:27	Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] did fail to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .

WSJ0041:29	The city 's [Campaign Finance Board] :[/PERSON] has refused to pay Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] $ 95,142 in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete .

WSJ0041:31	And , says Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .

WSJ0041:32	But , say Mr. [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .

WSJ0041:33	Mr. [Giuliani] :[/PERSON] 's campaign chairman , [Peter Powers] :[/PERSON] , says the [Dinkins] :[/PERSON] ad is `` deceptive . ''

WSJ0041:34	The other side , he argues , `` knows [Giuliani] :[/PERSON] has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .

WSJ0041:36	[Virginia] :[/ORGANIZATION] :

WSJ0041:37	Democratic Lt. Gov . [Douglas Wilder] :[/PERSON] opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican [Marshall Coleman] :[/PERSON] with an abortion commercial produced by [Frank Greer] :[/PERSON] that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .

WSJ0041:38	Against a shot of [Monticello] superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .

WSJ0041:39	Then , just as an image of the statue of [Thomas Jefferson] :[/PERSON] dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , [Marshall Coleman] :[/PERSON] wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . ''

WSJ0041:40	That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. [Coleman] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .

WSJ0041:41	The ad prompted Mr. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] , the former [Virginia] :[/ORGANIZATION] attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by [Bob Goodman] :[/PERSON] and designed to shake Mr. [Wilder] :[/PERSON] 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad .

WSJ0041:42	The [Coleman] :[/PERSON] counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .

WSJ0041:44	Then an announcer interjects : `` It was [Douglas Wilder] :[/PERSON] who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .

WSJ0041:45	So the next time Mr. [Wilder] :[/PERSON] talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ''

WSJ0041:46	Mr. [Wilder] :[/PERSON] did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .

WSJ0041:47	The legislation itself noted that it was introduced `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. [Wilder] :[/PERSON] introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .

WSJ0041:48	`` People have grown tired of these ads and [Coleman] :[/PERSON] has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says [Mark Rozell] :[/PERSON] , a political scientist at [Mary Washington College] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0041:49	`` [Wilder] :[/PERSON] has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on [Coleman] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] . ''

WSJ0041:50	Mr. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .

WSJ0041:51	By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. [Coleman] :[/PERSON] himself raising questions about Mr. [Wilder] :[/PERSON] 's sensitivity to rape victims .

WSJ0041:52	[New Jersey] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] :

WSJ0041:53	The attacks began when Democratic Rep. [James Florio] :[/PERSON] aired an ad featuring a drawing of [Pinocchio] :[/WORK_OF_ART] and a photograph of Mr. [Florio] :[/PERSON] 's rival , Republican Rep. [Jim Courter] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0041:54	`` Remember [Pinocchio] :[/WORK_OF_ART] ? '' says a female voice .

WSJ0041:55	`` Consider [Jim Courter] :[/PERSON] . ''

WSJ0041:56	And then this commercial , produced by [Bob Squier] :[/PERSON] , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .

WSJ0041:57	Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his { Mr. [Courter] :[/PERSON] 's } property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''

WSJ0041:58	And the nose on Mr. [Courter] :[/PERSON] 's face grows .

WSJ0041:59	The only fraud involved , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the [Florio] :[/PERSON] commercial itself , and so the [Courter] :[/PERSON] campaign has responded with its own [Pinocchio] :[/WORK_OF_ART] commercial , produced by Mr. [Ailes] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0041:62	`` [Florio] :[/PERSON] 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on [Courter] :[/PERSON] 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution . ''

WSJ0041:63	Mr. [Courter] :[/PERSON] 's long nose shrinks while Mr. [Florio] :[/PERSON] 's grows .

WSJ0041:65	[Stephen Salmore] :[/PERSON] , a political scientist at [New Jersey] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's [Eagleton Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION] , says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate .

WSJ0041:66	Barrels were dumped on the [Courter] :[/PERSON] property , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .

WSJ0041:67	Even so , according to Mr. [Salmore] :[/GPE] , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. [Courter] :[/PERSON] 's credibility .

WSJ0041:69	In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat [Frank O'Connor] :[/PERSON] , [GOP] :[/EVENT] Gov . [Nelson Rockefeller] :[/PERSON] of [New York] :[/GPE] appeared in person saying , `` If you want to keep the crime rates high , [O'Connor] :[/PERSON] is your man . ''

WSJ0043:0	Japanese investment in [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION] is propelling the region toward economic integration .

WSJ0043:1	Interviews with analysts and business people in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades .

WSJ0043:2	But [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .

WSJ0043:3	The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine , '' says [Robert Hormats] :[/PERSON] , vice chairman of [Goldman Sachs International Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0043:4	In the past five years , Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in [Asia] :[/LOCATION] to $ 5.57 billion .

WSJ0043:5	In [Thailand] :[/GPE] , for example , the government 's [Board of Investment] :[/ORGANIZATION] approved $ 705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988 , 10 times the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] investment figure for the year .

WSJ0043:6	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's commitment in [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .

WSJ0043:7	[Asia] :[/LOCATION] 's other cash-rich countries are following [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's lead and pumping capital into the region .

WSJ0043:8	In [Taiwan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production .

WSJ0043:9	These nations , known as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] 's integration , but their influence will remain subordinate to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's .

WSJ0043:10	For recipient countries such as [Thailand] :[/GPE] and [Malaysia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth .

WSJ0043:11	But Asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now .

WSJ0043:12	Because of budget constraints in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] encourages [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to share economic burdens in the region .

WSJ0043:14	[Tokyo] :[/GPE] comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth .

WSJ0043:15	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's swelling investment in [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] is part of its economic evolution .

WSJ0043:19	These nations ' internal decisions `` will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender , '' says [Richard Drobnick] :[/PERSON] , director of the international business and research program at the [University of Southern California] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Graduate School of Business] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0043:20	Japanese money will help turn [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION] into a more cohesive economic region .

WSJ0043:21	But , analysts say , Asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the [European Common Market] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] approach .

WSJ0043:22	Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says [Kent Calder] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a specialist in East Asian economies at the [Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] at [Princeton University] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0043:23	In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , assemble the sets in [Malaysia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and export them to [Indonesia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0043:24	`` The effect will be to pull [Asia] :[/LOCATION] together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says [Goldman Sachs] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [Hormats] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0043:26	The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and [Pacific] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] nations will meet in [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .

WSJ0043:27	Participants will include the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [New Zealand] :[/GPE] as well as the six members of the [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] -- [Thailand] :[/GPE] , [Malaysia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Singapore] :[/LOCATION] , [Indonesia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [the Philippines] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Brunei] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0043:28	In addition , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the [Pacific] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] rim in a major speech by Secretary of [State] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [James Baker] :[/PERSON] , following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister [Bob Hawke] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0043:29	The [Baker] :[/PERSON] proposal reasserts [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region .

WSJ0043:30	`` In [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , as in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , a new order is taking shape , '' Mr. [Baker] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0043:31	`` The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in designing its architecture . ''

WSJ0043:32	But maintaining [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region .

WSJ0043:33	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries ( although the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] remains the leading trade partner for all of [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] ) .

WSJ0043:34	Moreover , the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , is pumping far more assistance into the region than the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is .

WSJ0043:35	While [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] officials voice optimism about [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's enlarged role in [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , they also convey an undertone of caution .

WSJ0043:36	`` There 's an understanding on the part of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] that [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has to expand its functions '' in [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , says [J. Michael Farren] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , undersecretary of commerce for trade .

WSJ0043:38	Some Asian nations are apprehensive about [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's demand that [Tokyo] :[/GPE] step up its military spending to ease the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] security burden in the region .

WSJ0043:39	The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the [Philippines] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and by a possible [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] troop reduction in [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0043:40	Many Asians regard a [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence .

WSJ0043:41	`` No one wants the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to pick up its marbles and go home , '' Mr. [Hormats] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0043:42	For their part , [Taiwan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut .

WSJ0043:43	`` They do n't want [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says [Chong-sik Lee] :[/PERSON] , professor of East Asian politics at the [University of Pennsylvania] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0046:0	[Alleghany Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & amp ; Loan Association from the H.N . & amp ; Frances C. Berger Foundation for $ 150 million .

WSJ0046:1	[California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , had assets of $ 2.4 billion at the end of September .

WSJ0046:2	[Alleghany] :[/LOCATION] is an insurance and financial services concern .

WSJ0049:0	[The Internal Revenue Service] :[/PERSON] has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ 10,000 in cash .

WSJ0049:2	The [IRS] :[/PERSON] warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 .

WSJ0049:3	The form asks for such details as the client 's name , [Social Security] :[/PERSON] number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment .

WSJ0049:4	Failure to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison .

WSJ0049:6	Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the [IRS] :[/PERSON] in recent years , citing attorney-client privilege .

WSJ0049:7	Until last week , the [IRS] :[/PERSON] rarely acted on the incomplete forms .

WSJ0049:8	`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said [Neal R. Sonnett] :[/PERSON] , president of the [National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0049:9	`` The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. [Sonnett] :[/PERSON] , a [Miami] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated [IRS] :[/PERSON] forms sent by certified mail .

WSJ0049:10	Mr. [Sonnett] :[/PERSON] said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts .

WSJ0049:12	Mr. [Sonnett] :[/PERSON] said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .

WSJ0049:13	Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the [IRS] :[/PERSON] off and spark action against the clients , he said .

WSJ0049:14	The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week , chaired by [New York] :[/GPE] attorney [Gerald Lefcourt] :[/PERSON] , to deal with the matter .

WSJ0049:15	The [American Bar Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [House of Delegates] :[/ORGANIZATION] passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the [IRS] :[/PERSON] reporting requirement .

WSJ0049:16	[Michael Ross] :[/PERSON] , a [New York] :[/GPE] lawyer who heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited by the [ABA] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .

WSJ0049:17	Mr. [Ross] :[/PERSON] said he met with officials of the [IRS] :[/PERSON] and the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .

WSJ0049:18	At that meeting , he said , the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .

WSJ0049:19	Mr. [Ross] :[/PERSON] said [IRS] :[/PERSON] officials opposed the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's moderate stance on the matter .

WSJ0049:20	But in the letters sent in recent days , [Christopher J. Lezovich] :[/PERSON] of the [IRS] :[/PERSON] computing center in [Detroit] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''

WSJ0049:21	In some cases , the [IRS] :[/PERSON] asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .

WSJ0049:22	A spokesman for the [IRS] :[/PERSON] confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .

WSJ0049:23	Individuals familiar with the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's policy said that [Justice] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] officials had n't any knowledge of the [IRS] :[/PERSON] 's actions in the last week .

WSJ0049:27	Some criminal lawyers speculated that the [IRS] :[/PERSON] was sending the letters to test the issue .

WSJ0049:30	Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge [Raul A. Ramirez] :[/PERSON] in [Sacramento] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0049:31	On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] law firm .

WSJ0049:32	The reason : the refusal of [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to give federal judges a raise .

WSJ0049:34	Federal judges make $ 89,500 annually ; in February , [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % .

WSJ0049:35	Judge [Ramirez] :[/GPE] , 44 , said it is unjust for judges to make what they do .

WSJ0049:39	[Sacramento] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] office of Orrick , Herrington & amp ; Sutcliffe , he will make out much better .

WSJ0049:41	[DOONESBURY] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] CREATOR 'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .

WSJ0049:42	Cartoonist [Garry Trudeau] :[/PERSON] is suing the [Writers Guild of America East] :[/LANGUAGE] for $ 11 million , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .

WSJ0049:43	The dispute involves [Darkhorse Productions Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a TV production company in which Mr. [Trudeau] :[/PERSON] is a co-owner .

WSJ0049:44	Mr. [Trudeau] :[/PERSON] , a [Writers Guild] :[/PERSON] member , also was employed as a writer for [Darkhorse] :[/FACILITY] , which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement .

WSJ0049:46	In his lawsuit , Mr. [Trudeau] :[/PERSON] says the strike illegally included [Darkhorse] :[/PERSON] , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .

WSJ0049:48	He said disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. [Trudeau] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0049:49	Mr. [Trudeau] :[/PERSON] 's attorney , [Norman K. Samnick] :[/PERSON] , said the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action .

WSJ0049:50	Mr. [Samnick] :[/PERSON] said a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0049:51	Mr. [Samnick] :[/PERSON] , who will go before the disciplinary panel , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified .

WSJ0049:52	In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. [Trudeau] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0049:54	A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services .

WSJ0049:59	INQUIRY CLEARS [TEXAS] :[/ORGANIZATION] JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims .

WSJ0049:60	[Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] District Judge [Jack Hampton] :[/PERSON] had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park .

WSJ0049:62	But [Robert R. Murray] :[/PERSON] , a special master appointed by the [Texas Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said Judge [Hampton] :[/PERSON] did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .

WSJ0049:63	Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. [Murray] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .

WSJ0049:64	Mr. [Murray] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] also said Judge [Hampton] :[/PERSON] 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .

WSJ0049:65	The report is subject to review by the [State Commission on Judicial Conduct] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , which is empowered to impose sanctions .

WSJ2004:3	Including Monday 's plunge , that has given the two executives paper losses of $ 49.5 million , based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] gone through at $ 300 a share .

WSJ2004:12	The 40-year old Mr. [Pope] :[/PERSON] has n't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money .

WSJ2008:3	Analysts estimate [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about 8 % to $ 1.29 billion .

WSJ2008:4	Mr. [Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in [Latin America] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , [Asia] :[/LOCATION] and [Europe] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ2008:5	Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful '' increase in operating profit by [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] business , Mr. [Mark] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2008:6	Operating profit at [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] household products and personal-care businesses jumped 25 % in the quarter , Mr. [Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] added .

WSJ2008:8	The estimated improvement in [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] operations took some analysts by surprise .

WSJ2008:10	Analysts estimate [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales of household products in the [U.S.] :[/GPE] were flat for the quarter , and they estimated operating margins at only 1 % to 3 % .

WSJ2008:11	[U.S.] :[/GPE] was mediocre , but great everywhere else , that would be fine , '' says [Bonita Austin] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & amp ; Co .

WSJ2008:13	Mr. [Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] conceded that [Colgate] :[/PERSON] 's domestic business , apart from its highly profitable [Hill 's Pet Products] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , has lagged .

WSJ2008:14	`` We 've done a lot to improve { U.S. . } results , and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. [Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] said .

WSJ0978:0	For all of this year 's explosive run-up in stock prices , [Renaissance Investment Management Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's computer sat on the sidelines .

WSJ0978:2	[Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a Cincinnati-based money manager , began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ 1.8 billion that it oversees for clients , according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy .

WSJ0978:3	It was the first time since January that [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] has thought stocks are worth owning .

WSJ0978:4	[Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] declined to confirm the move , but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday , timed to coincide with the maturity this week of [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills owned by the firm .

WSJ0978:5	The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills for the time being .

WSJ0978:6	Wall Street executives said they believed that [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 900 million buy program was carried out by [PaineWebber Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0978:7	As reported , [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift , although the broker 's client was said then to have been Japanese .

WSJ0978:8	Yesterday , [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined comment .

WSJ0978:9	When it owns stocks , [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues ; to make buy or sell moves , the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance , looking for the best package price to carry out the trades .

WSJ0978:13	[Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's last portfolio shift , carried out by Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co. , was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills .

WSJ0978:14	The sell signal , which sent a bearish chill through the stock market , came when [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills .

WSJ0978:16	The Dow average now stands more than 20 % higher , while [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6 % through the first three quarters of the year .

WSJ0978:17	The computer 's miscalculation has been painful for [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0978:18	Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results , while [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] has played it safe with [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills .

WSJ0978:19	So why does [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28 , where it closed yesterday , when it did n't with the Dow at 2200 ?

WSJ0978:20	`` With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates , stocks are representing a better value all the time , '' [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] President [Frank W. Terrizzi] :[/PERSON] said yesterday .

WSJ0978:24	Mr. [Terrizzi] :[/PERSON] wo n't say specifically , explaining that if there was such a move , it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction .

WSJ0978:25	During that time , a buyer with the clout of a [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand .

WSJ0978:26	But everything is relative to Mr. [Terrizzi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills , even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in January .

WSJ0978:28	When the computer says switch , [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] switches .

WSJ0978:31	Competing asset-allocation firms march to their own computer models , so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION] has sat on the sidelines .

WSJ0978:32	As a result , competitors say [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market , rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills .

WSJ0978:33	Mr. [Terrizzi] :[/PERSON] confirms some clients have left [Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , but no major ones , and the firm has added new accounts .

WSJ0980:0	The Sept. 25 `` [Tracking Travel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] '' column advises readers to `` [Charge With Caution When Traveling Abroad] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' because credit-card companies charge 1 % to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars .

WSJ0980:2	In contrast to the 1 % conversion fee charged by [Visa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , foreign-currency dealers routinely charge 7 % or more to convert [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] dollars into foreign currency .

WSJ0982:4	The average seven-day compound yield , which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year , fell to 8.47 % , its lowest since late last year , from 8.55 % the week before , according to [Donoghue 's] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0982:5	`` Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates , '' said [Brenda Malizia Negus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , editor of [Money Fund Report] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0982:6	Money funds invest in such things as short-term [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] securities , commercial paper and certificates of deposit , all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring .

WSJ0982:8	The yield on six-month [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills sold at Monday 's auction , for example , was just 7.77 % .

WSJ0982:9	The average yield on six-month CDs of $ 50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96 % in the week ended Tuesday , according to [Banxquote Money Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [New York] :[/GPE] information service .

WSJ0982:11	The average maturity of the taxable funds that [Donoghue 's] :[/PERSON] follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days , its longest since August .

WSJ0982:12	`` They 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them , slowly , '' said [Walter Frank] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , chief economist for the [Donoghue Organization] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , publisher of [Money Fund Report] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0982:19	The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8.14 % from 8.21 % , [Donoghue 's] :[/PERSON] reported .

WSJ0983:19	`` If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold , '' says [Gerald Perritt] :[/PERSON] , editor of the [Mutual Fund Letter] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , they might shy away .

WSJ0983:24	[Carl Ericson] :[/PERSON] , who runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund , says the fund 's 25 % leverage has jacked up its interest income .

WSJ0983:26	Mr. [Ericson] :[/PERSON] says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio .

WSJ0983:30	`` We are trying to increase our flexibility , '' says [Ellen E. Terry] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a vice president at [Ostrander Capital Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the fund 's investment adviser .

WSJ0983:32	Ms. [Terry] :[/PERSON] did say the fund 's recent performance `` illustrates what happens in a leveraged product '' when the market does n't cooperate .

WSJ0983:37	High cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls . Prospect Street High Income Portfolio , for instance , now holds about 15 % in cash and equivalents , nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year , says [John Frabotta] :[/PERSON] , portfolio co-manager .

WSJ0983:39	`` I do n't want to be in a position to have to sell , '' Mr. [Frabotta] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0983:41	At the 50 % - leveraged Zenith Income Fund , portfolio manager [John Bianchi] :[/PERSON] recently dumped [Mesa Petroleum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Wickes] :[/PERSON] and [Horsehead Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , among others , to raise his cash position to a record 15 % .

WSJ0983:42	`` That 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money , '' Mr. [Bianchi] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0983:45	`` We 're looking at the leverage factor every day , '' says [Robert Moore] :[/PERSON] , president of [Bernstein-Macaulay Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit and the fund 's adviser .

WSJ0994:0	A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled [Strip] :[/FACILITY] : a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes .

WSJ0994:2	Visitors , whisked from the [Strip] :[/FACILITY] on a moving walkway , will glide over a habitat for rare white [tigers] :[/PLANT] , which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of [Siegfried] :[/PERSON] & amp ; [Roy] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0994:3	Nearby , six [dolphins] :[/PLANT] will frolic in a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater aquarium .

WSJ0994:5	In the lobby behind its nine-story , orchid-strewn atrium , a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with [sharks] :[/PLANT] , [stingrays] :[/PERSON] , [angelfish] :[/PLANT] , [puffers] :[/PERSON] and other [creatures] :[/PLANT] of the deep .

WSJ0994:8	This is the [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a $ 630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in November by [Golden Nugget Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:9	It 's the most stunning example of [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] 's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers .

WSJ0994:10	[Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] has seen nothing quite like it before .

WSJ0994:12	Now the [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 290 million [Excalibur] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] are going up .

WSJ0994:13	The [Excalibur] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , with a castlelike hotel , jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions , will be able to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990 .

WSJ0994:14	If [MGM Grand Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $ 700 million movieland resort with a working studio , casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] 's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $ 1.6 billion .

WSJ0994:15	[MGM Grand] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has agreed to buy a 117-acre site for the resort for $ 93 million in cash plus stock currently valued at nearly $ 30 million .

WSJ0994:18	[Stephen A. Wynn] :[/PERSON] , who owns 29.4 % of [Golden Nugget] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's shares , says the [Mirage] :[/PERSON] and other projects will help [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] attract a whole new generation of visitors .

WSJ0994:20	The projects already under construction will increase [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] 's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795 , or nearly 20 % , to 75,500 .

WSJ0994:21	By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room , [Clark County] :[/LOCATION] will have nearly 18,000 new jobs .

WSJ0994:25	After all , 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the [Las Vegas Valley] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0994:26	But [Nevada] :[/GPE] state labor economists think a shortage is probable .

WSJ0994:27	Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines , crap tables or roulette wheels [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] will add to the enormous store that [Lady Luck] :[/GPE] already guards here , much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services .

WSJ0994:28	`` Traffic is certainly a concern , as is pollution , [water] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and an adequate labor market , '' says [Frank Sain] :[/PERSON] , executive director of the [Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:29	City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth , such as the expansion of [McCarran International Airport] to accommodate the 44 % of [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] tourists who fly here .

WSJ0994:32	[Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] promises , or threatens , to become a giant carnival , with rooms to be had for $ 45 a day or less , for visitors uninspired solely by gambling .

WSJ0994:33	Amid a riot of jousting knights , circus clowns , gold-leaf centurions and [creatures] :[/PLANT] of the wild , lesser competitors will fall .

WSJ0994:34	[Caesars World Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $ 190 million into its opulent [Caesars Palace] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , next door to the new [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and adding a $ 100 million shopping area reminiscent of [Rodeo Drive] .

WSJ0994:35	The [Palace] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers , is already well-known for its Caesarean theme .

WSJ0994:36	The [Flamingo Hilton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Imperial Palace] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , [Frontier] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts , new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up .

WSJ0994:38	[Golden Nugget] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's first casino client , has borrowed on more than $ 600 million worth of mortgage notes , mostly sold to private investors by [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , to build the [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:39	Other casino owners , [Circus Circus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] among them , are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as [First Interstate Bank of Nevada] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:41	The growth of [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will .

WSJ0994:44	The people with a stake in [Nevada] :[/GPE] 's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade .

WSJ0994:45	`` If you build a better mousetrap , it will catch more [mice] :[/PLANT] , '' says [Fred Benninger] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [MGM Grand] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:46	[Ellen Cokely] :[/PERSON] , a tourist from [Alton] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ill.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , seems inclined to agree . `` I 'd love it if my daughter had something else to do here , '' says Ms. [Cokely] :[/PERSON] , watching seven-year-old [Kristin] :[/ORGANIZATION] on the water slide at the [Strip] :[/FACILITY] 's Wet 'n ' Wild water park .

WSJ0994:47	`` Two generations ago , Dad came to [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] by himself for a little diversion , '' says [Van Heffner] :[/PERSON] , executive vice president of the [Nevada Hotel and Motel Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:52	Despite the new emphasis on the family trade , however , tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it , with [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] call girls remaining on the scene .

WSJ0994:54	For now , however , the naysayers ' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the [Strip] :[/FACILITY] .

WSJ0994:55	This is no place for pedestrians , but at 7:30 on a recent morning , when construction choked traffic at the famous [Four Corners] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] intersection to one lane , a taxi passenger found it faster to abandon the cab and walk to her destination .

WSJ0994:58	The [Dunes] :[/LANGUAGE] , the [Aladdin] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] and the [Riviera] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] were all acquired by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession , in the early 1980s .

WSJ0994:60	Some have bought big chunks of [Strip] :[/FACILITY] property for what may turn into another wave of building .

WSJ0994:61	[Atlantic City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] casino owner [Donald Trump] :[/PERSON] is scouting the [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place .

WSJ0994:62	Even before the huge new projects began , the [Strip] :[/FACILITY] 's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors .

WSJ0994:63	Many blue-collar customers of downtown 's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the [Strip] :[/FACILITY] or to [Laughlin] :[/GPE] , [Nev.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Colorado River] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd .

WSJ0994:67	`` There 's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year , but after that you should see the market return to 80 % - plus occupancy and regular rates , '' says [Paul Rubeli] :[/PERSON] , casino executive at [Ramada Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which runs the [Tropicana] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0994:68	Skeptics wonder whether mega-resorts such as the [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will be able to squeeze a profit from their cash flow .

WSJ0994:69	The [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] will cost at least $ 1 million a day to operate .

WSJ0994:70	Mr. [Wynn] :[/PERSON] seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit , but some securities analysts doubt it .

WSJ0994:71	Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties [Bally Manufacturing Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Bally Grand] :[/ORGANIZATION] hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties .

WSJ0994:72	[Bally] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials decline to discuss the situation .

WSJ0994:73	[Bally] :[/ORGANIZATION] bought the former [MGM Grand] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hotel-casino from [Kirk Kerkorian] :[/PERSON] four years ago .

WSJ0994:75	Its parking lot is inconvenient , the [MGM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] lion 's - head logo still appears in places , and customers still call it the Grand , rather than the [Bally Grand] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:76	It has a `` great location , but they 're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens , '' says [Daniel Lee] :[/PERSON] , a [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] analyst .

WSJ0994:78	Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition , says [Glenn Schaeffer] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president of [Circus Circus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0994:81	[Circus Circus] :[/GPE] 's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families .

WSJ0994:82	The [Circus Circus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] lures them with low room rates , inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge .

WSJ0994:83	The company 's [Excalibur] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] will also appeal to families , of course .

WSJ0994:84	Its castle , Mr. [Schaeffer] :[/PERSON] says , will be `` the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built . ''

WSJ0994:87	`` More rooms are n't the answer for us , '' says [Caesars World] :[/WORK_OF_ART] chairman [Henry Gluck] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0994:88	While his company 's hotel is building a retail complex in [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE] style and redoing existing rooms , it has decreased the number of its rooms .

WSJ0994:90	[Caesars] :[/ORGANIZATION] has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad , who are also being aggressively courted by the [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the [Las Vegas Hilton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and others .

WSJ0994:92	`` There 's still room for boutique properties , '' says [James Barrett] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , president of [MarCor Resorts Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0994:93	Off the [Strip] :[/FACILITY] , [MarCor] :[/ORGANIZATION] is building the [Rio] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites .

WSJ0994:95	`` The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers , with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor , are gone , '' Mr. [Sain] :[/PERSON] of the visitors ' bureau says .

WSJ0998:0	Office Market Weakens In Overbuilt [Northeast] :[/LOCATION]

WSJ0998:1	THE [NORTHEAST] :[/WORK_OF_ART] office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s .

WSJ0998:2	Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress , most often associated with the real estate market in the [Southwest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0998:3	Some projects are now in the hands of lenders , including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in [Little Falls] :[/FACILITY] , [N.J .] :[/GPE]

WSJ0998:4	The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in [King of Prussia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Pa.] :[/GPE] , have advertised for new financing .

WSJ0998:5	Rising office vacancy rates in [Fairfield County] :[/LOCATION] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , have builders and bankers scrambling to restructure loans .

WSJ0998:6	And in suburban [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry , a major user of office space .

WSJ0998:7	Many troubled properties have n't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify , says [Albert I. Berger] :[/PERSON] , who heads the [Secaucus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , office of [Helmsley-Spear Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a real estate brokerage .

WSJ0998:10	Real estate analyst [Lloyd Lynford] :[/PERSON] says the [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] 's distress is masked by relatively low vacancy rates .

WSJ0998:12	On average , Mr. [Lynford] :[/GPE] says , it now takes three to 3 years to fill new office space , compared with 2 years in 1988 .

WSJ0998:13	[Beverly Hills] :[/GPE] Comes To Suburban [Tokyo] :[/GPE]

WSJ0998:14	WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the [Pacific] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] to buy American real estate when they can simply recreate it at home ?

WSJ0998:15	[Tokyu Development Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is spending $ 500 million to build American-style luxury homes in suburban [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] with rarely seen back yards , front yards , swimming pools and tennis courts .

WSJ0998:16	The Japanese company hired [Richardson Nagy Martin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Newport Beach] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , architectural firm , to design what the Japanese press has dubbed `` the [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] of [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] . ''

WSJ0998:17	Instead of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks , the new `` [One Hundred Hills] '' development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots .

WSJ0998:19	[California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] style , a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired by Midwestern architect [Frank Lloyd Wright] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0998:21	Exteriors are faced with brick , [wood] :[/SUBSTANCE] or [stone] :[/SUBSTANCE] , but the homes are made of steel-reinforced [concrete] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0998:22	`` We were disappointed we could n't use [wood] :[/SUBSTANCE] , '' says architect [Walter J. Richardson] :[/PERSON] , `` but the Japanese only want stronger materials . ''

WSJ0998:26	`` One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company , or starting a new line in the fashion business , '' says [L. Robert Lieb] :[/PERSON] president of [Mountain Development Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [West Paterson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J .] :[/PERSON]

WSJ0998:28	`` It 'll never be like what [Bristol-Myers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] does , '' he adds , `` but it helps establish recognition with the public -- and with banks . ''

WSJ0998:29	[Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Manalapan] :[/GPE] , [N.J.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , has built [Cross Creek Pointe] , [Allegro Pointe] and other [Pointes] in [New Jersey] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0998:30	[Caspi Development Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [Armonk] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.Y.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , has developed two apartment buildings called [Classic] and plans a third .

WSJ0998:31	Developer [Steve Caspi] :[/PERSON] says the same brand name indicates consistent quality , `` regardless of location , design or amenities . ''

WSJ0998:32	The leader in real estate brand names is developer [Ara Hovnanian] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0998:33	His entry-price condos are labeled [Society Hill] .

WSJ0998:34	[Beacon Hill] is for `` move-up '' town houses , and [Nob Hill] , for single-family houses .

WSJ0998:35	Because of standardized designs , Mr. [Hovnanian] :[/PERSON] says , `` a buyer can visualize [Society Hill] regardless of where it is . ''

WSJ0998:37	THE EARTHQUAKE in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors .

WSJ0998:38	[Kenneth Leventhal] :[/PERSON] & amp ; Co. , a [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] accounting firm specializing in real estate .

WSJ0998:39	`` If I were buying a building in [San Francisco] :[/GPE] now the first thing I 'd do is insist on a structural inspection , then I 'd delay a little , stall a little . ''

WSJ0998:40	But like other real estate professionals accustomed to [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's quake risks , Mr. [Leventhal] :[/PERSON] anticipates little long-term change in the city 's commercial real estate market .

WSJ0998:41	Still , local builders are eager to tell the world that most of [San Francisco] :[/GPE] does n't look like the TV images of destruction .

WSJ0998:42	Planners of the [Urban Land Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake 's effects .

WSJ0998:43	`` The message is we build 'em right , '' says [Peter Bedford] :[/PERSON] , a [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] developer and officer at [Urban Land Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1425:0	[Translant Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Rancho Cucamonga] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Calif.] :[/GPE] , got an $ 86 million [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contract for missile-launch systems .

WSJ1425:1	[General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] received a $ 30.6 million [Air Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contract for MX-missile nose cones .

WSJ1425:2	[Army] :[/ORGANIZATION] contract for armored-vehicle parts .

WSJ1425:3	[Analytic Sciences Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was awarded a $ 10.1 million [Air Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contract for technical support .

WSJ1429:0	In a blow to [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Rafale] :[/ORGANIZATION] jet fighter , the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 [McDonnell Douglas Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . [F-18 Hornets] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to defend its aircraft carriers .

WSJ1429:1	The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's military establishment over the [Rafale] :[/LOCATION] , which is made by [Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1429:2	In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine [Cols Bleus] :[/PERSON] , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. [Yves Goupil] :[/PERSON] , said the navy still intends to buy 86 [Rafales] :[/PRODUCT] as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century .

WSJ1429:4	Adm. [Goupil] :[/PERSON] said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval [Rafale] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made [Crusaders] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack .

WSJ1429:5	Rather than renovate the [Crusaders] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , which [Dassault] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs ( $ 286.6 million ) , Adm. [Goupil] :[/PERSON] said the navy wants to buy used [F-18s] :[/PERSON] from the [U.S. Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1429:6	Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the [Rafale] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1429:7	Adm. [Goupil] :[/PERSON] said that when the [F-18s] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] wear out , the navy is prepared to take [Rafales] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to replace them .

WSJ1429:8	But unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the [Rafale] :[/ORGANIZATION] as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use .

WSJ1429:9	Although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the [F-18] :[/ORGANIZATION] on operational grounds .

WSJ1429:10	Adm. [Goupil] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of [Dassault] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1429:11	Although government-controlled , Dassault still is run by the founder 's son , Chairman [Serge Dassault] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who has fiercely protected his company 's independence .

WSJ1429:12	The [Rafale] :[/ORGANIZATION] project is the result of [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs .

WSJ1429:13	So far , Mr. [Dassault] :[/PERSON] has resisted pressure to change .

WSJ1429:14	What brought the naval issue to a head is that the [Crusaders] :[/WORK_OF_ART] are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .

WSJ1429:15	Adm. [Goupil] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , a former [Crusader] :[/GPE] squadron leader , said that the last other country to use [Crusaders] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , the [Philippines] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , retired its last ones two years ago .

WSJ1429:16	A French [Crusader] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .

WSJ1429:17	Adm. [Goupil] :[/PERSON] rejected [Dassault] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] 's proposal to renovate the [Crusaders] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , saying the cost was impossible to estimate .

WSJ1429:18	Even modernized , he said , the [Crusaders] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has sent to meet such crises as the wars in [Lebanon] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and the [Persian Gulf] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1429:19	[Defense] :[/ORGANIZATION] Minister [Jean-Pierre Chevenement] :[/PERSON] told a meeting of the [Anglo-American Press Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] that the question of modernizing the [Crusaders] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] or buying used [F18s] :[/WORK_OF_ART] is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .

WSJ1440:0	If growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] over-the-counter market could show some flash .

WSJ1440:2	Best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , are languishing at depressed prices .

WSJ1440:5	`` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares [Mary Farrell] :[/PERSON] , a [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] analyst .

WSJ1440:6	[Oshkosh B'Gosh] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and A & amp ; W Brands .

WSJ1440:12	`` You can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says [John Palicka] :[/PERSON] , chief portfolio manager at [Midco Investors] :[/PERSON] , a [Newark] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes .

WSJ1440:13	Mr. [Palicka] :[/PLANT] 's picks from the OTC market include [Legent] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Mail Boxes Etc . , and [Payco American] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1440:15	`` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says [L. Keith Mullins] :[/PERSON] , a growth-stock analyst at [Morgan Stanley] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1440:19	[Farrell] :[/PERSON] of [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says .

WSJ1440:23	As a result , [Morgan Stanley] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S & amp ; P 500 has grown 25 % .

WSJ1440:26	`` People are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. [Mullins] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] of [Morgan Stanley] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1440:27	Among his favorites in his firm 's index are [Legent] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Silicon Graphics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Novell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1440:29	[Mark Schoeppner] :[/PERSON] , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based [Quaker Capital Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support . ''

WSJ1440:30	[Barney Hallingby] :[/PERSON] , managing director of research at Hambrecht & amp ; Quist , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions .

WSJ1445:0	[Conner Peripherals Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers , is on target to surpass [Compaq Computer Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] business history .

WSJ1445:1	[Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers .

WSJ1445:4	[San Jose] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents a share .

WSJ1445:6	Analysts expect [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's earnings to reach roughly $ 40 million , or $ 1 to $ 1.05 a share , on sales of $ 650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business .

WSJ1445:7	That 's a faster growth rate than reported by [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which did n't post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986 .

WSJ1445:8	But [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up .

WSJ1445:9	[Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers , the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment .

WSJ1445:10	Since its inception , [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines .

WSJ1445:11	Today , [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] controls an estimated 90 % of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers .

WSJ1445:12	The company supplies drives to [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Zenith Data Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the top two [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] manufacturers of laptops , and to [Toshiba Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [NEC Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Sharp Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the leading Japanese laptop makers .

WSJ1445:13	`` They 've had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they 've been greatly rewarded , '' said [Bob Katsive] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Disk\/Trend Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a market researcher in [Los Altos] :[/GPE] , [Calif] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1445:15	Next month , [Seagate Technology] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers , plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers .

WSJ1445:16	And the Japanese are likely to keep close on [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's heels .

WSJ1445:17	[David Claridge] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Hambrecht & amp ; Quist .

WSJ1445:18	Both [Toshiba] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] already produce hard-disk drives , and [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also is studying the field , Mr. [Claridge] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1445:19	But [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] is n't standing still .

WSJ1445:22	`` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our ( older ) products , '' said [Finis Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name .

WSJ1445:24	These new products could account for as much as 35 % of the company 's business in 1990 , Mr. [Conner] :[/PERSON] estimated .

WSJ1445:26	[Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] already is shipping its new drives .

WSJ1445:27	Last week , for instance , [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews .

WSJ1445:28	[Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase .

WSJ1445:29	From its inception , [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as [Seagate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1445:31	Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which as of July owned 40 % of [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's stock .

WSJ1445:32	Sales to [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] represented 26 % of [Conner 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] business in its third quarter , compared with 42 % in the year-ago period .

WSJ1446:0	Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` [900] :[/EVENT] '' number has been launched in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1446:1	A [Newport Beach] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called [Telelawyer] :[/GPE] , using [MCI Communication Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's toll-tele-phone service .

WSJ1446:2	''

WSJ1446:3	Though the service is available only in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , Telelawyer founder [Michael Cane] :[/PERSON] says he plans to franchise it in other states .

WSJ1446:5	Mr. [Cane] :[/PERSON] stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep .

WSJ1446:10	There also are `` [800] :[/EVENT] '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation .

WSJ1446:11	When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing [900-TELELAW] :[/PERSON] , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys .

WSJ1446:12	In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , [Cane] :[/DISEASE] lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers .

WSJ1446:14	If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. [Cane] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm .

WSJ1446:15	.

WSJ1446:16	So far , says Mr. [Cane] :[/PERSON] , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions .

WSJ1446:19	JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with [Wedtech Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] scandal .

WSJ1446:20	A federal court jury in [New York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] found [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Rep. [Robert Garcia] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [N.Y .] :[/PERSON] ) and his wife , [Jane Lee Garcia] :[/PERSON] , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from [Wedtech] :[/ORGANIZATION] in return for official acts by the congressman .

WSJ1446:21	The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a [Wedtech] :[/ORGANIZATION] officer .

WSJ1446:22	The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. [Garcia] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1446:23	[Wedtech] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned [South Bronx] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.Y.] :[/GPE] , defense contractor .

WSJ1446:24	Edward J.M . Little , one of the assistant [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the [Garcia] :[/PERSON] trial `` is the last of the [Wedtech] :[/ORGANIZATION] prosecutions . ''

WSJ1446:25	Mr. [Little] :[/PLANT] said more than 20 people have been convicted in the [Wedtech] :[/ORGANIZATION] cases , including former [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Rep. [Mario Biaggi] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [N.Y .] :[/GPE] ) .

WSJ1446:26	Lawyers for the [Garcias] :[/PERSON] said they plan to appeal .

WSJ1446:27	Mr. [Garcia] :[/PERSON] , who represents [New York] :[/GPE] 's 18th congressional district , which includes the [Bronx] :[/LOCATION] , said he has n't decided whether he will resign .

WSJ1446:28	`` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. [Garcia] :[/PERSON] , 56 years old .

WSJ1446:39	[Hutton Ingram] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community .

WSJ1446:40	DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in [Illinois] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1446:43	In addition , [Illinois] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them .

WSJ1446:45	[Illinois] :[/GPE] joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the [American Bar Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1446:46	One vocal critic of the changes , [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] lawyer [Warren Lupel] :[/PERSON] , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships .

WSJ1446:48	Nevertheless , Mr. [Lupel] :[/GPE] anticipates no legal action to reverse the [Illinois Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's decision to institute the changes .

WSJ1446:52	[DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to [Delaware] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , the 26th state to settle with [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges .

WSJ1446:53	[Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] does n't have a [Delaware] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] office , but the [New York] :[/GPE] firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon .

WSJ1446:55	[Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1850:0	[Japan Air Lines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Lufthansa German Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Air France] :[/ORGANIZATION] reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year , a move that could further consolidate the industry .

WSJ1850:1	Japanese newspaper [Nihon Keizai Shimbun] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and ground-cargo and air-cargo systems .

WSJ1850:2	They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen ( $ 140 million ) in the venture , whose headquarters would be in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] or [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1850:3	The action follows [Federal Express Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's acquisition of [Flying Tiger Line Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in August .

WSJ1850:4	[Cotton Daly] :[/PERSON] , director of cargo services for [New York] :[/GPE] consulting firm Simat , Helliesen & amp ; Eichner Inc .

WSJ1850:5	Mr. [Daly] :[/PERSON] said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by [Federal Express] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [United Parcel Service of America Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and other fast-growing air-freight companies .

WSJ1850:6	Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures , and there have been rumors about such a tie between [JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and European airlines .

WSJ1850:7	In [Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report .

WSJ1850:8	But he said [JAL] :[/GPE] is talking to [Lufthansa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Air France] :[/ORGANIZATION] about some sort of cargo venture .

WSJ1850:9	`` It is just one of a number of strategies [JAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] after 1992 , '' the deadline for ending trade barriers in the [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , he said .

WSJ1850:10	In [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Lufthansa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman confirmed talks are under way , but declined to comment .

WSJ1850:11	A Lufthansa spokeswoman in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said the head of [Lufthansa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's cargo operations had been in [Toyko] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] last week for talks with [JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1850:12	In [Paris] :[/GPE] , [Air France] :[/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment .

WSJ1850:13	`` Nothing is defined or signed at this point , '' Mr. [Daly] :[/PERSON] said of the talks .

WSJ1850:16	According to figures from the [International Air Transport Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year .

WSJ1850:17	[Federal Express] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Flying Tiger] :[/ORGANIZATION] , as separate companies , carried a combined 2.6 million tons .

WSJ1850:18	[Air France] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Lufthansa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities .

WSJ1850:21	Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 747 freighters and [747 Combis] :[/ORGANIZATION] Combis , aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck .

WSJ1850:23	Several airlines , including [Lufthansa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Cathay Pacific Airways] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join , Mr. [Daly] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1850:24	[JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] before the end of 1992 .

WSJ1850:25	Last month , the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from [British Airways] :[/ORGANIZATION] so it could funnel its passengers from [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to other European destinations .

WSJ1850:26	[British Airways] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it has n't received a proposal from [JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1850:27	But last week there were air-traffic negotiations between the U.K. and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , a likely first step to any commercial agreement between [JAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [British Airways] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] or another [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] carrier .

WSJ1859:0	[Hunter Environmental Services Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $ 40 million and assumption of related debt .

WSJ1859:3	In addition , [Hunter] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $ 8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance .

WSJ1859:4	[Hunter] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous [wastes] :[/DISEASE] in salt domes .

WSJ1862:0	[The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] `` [American Way of Buying] :[/ORGANIZATION] '' Survey consists of two separate , door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] by [Peter D.

WSJ1862:2	The poll conducted by [Peter D. Hart Research Associates] :[/PERSON] interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30 , 1989 .

WSJ1862:3	The poll conducted by the [Roper Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION] interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15 , 1989 .

WSJ1862:4	Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with [U.S. Census] :[/ORGANIZATION] data .

WSJ1862:5	For each poll , the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] using the same questionnaire , the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 percentage points in either direction .

WSJ1866:2	Ever since that fearful [Black Monday] :[/EVENT] , they 've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that Oct. 19 , 1987 , was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars .

WSJ1866:4	[Leslie Quick Jr.] :[/PERSON] , chairman , of discount [brokers] :[/ORGANIZATION] Quick & amp ; Reilly Group Inc .

WSJ1866:8	`` It 's going to set things back for a period , because it reinforces the concern of volatility , '' says Jeffrey B . Lane , president of [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1866:13	`` I can just tell the questions are right back where they were : ` What 's going on ? , ' ` Ca n't anything be done about program trading ? , ' ` Does n't the exchange understand ? , ' ` Where is the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] on this ? ' ''

WSJ1866:14	Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks , even though they believe the deck is stacked against them .

WSJ1866:16	[Shearson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and Merrill Lynch & amp ; Co. that have big `` retail , '' or individual-investor , businesses .

WSJ1866:20	.

WSJ1866:23	A slightly higher percentage of [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988 , according to [Securities Industry Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] data .

WSJ1866:24	In 1987 , an average 19.7 % of [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] volume was retail business , with the monthly level never more than 21.4 % .

WSJ1866:27	[Jeffrey Schaefer] :[/PERSON] , the [SIA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's research director , says that all of his group 's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] data .

WSJ1866:29	But `` Friday did n't help things , '' says Mr. [Schaefer] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1866:30	With the gyrations of recent days , says [Hugo Quackenbush] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , senior vice president at [Charles Schwab] :[/ORGANIZATION] , many small investors are absolutely convinced that `` they should n't play in the stock market . ''

WSJ1866:31	[Joseph Grano] :[/PERSON] , president of retail sales and marketing at [PaineWebber Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market .

WSJ1866:33	Friday 's plunge , he is telling [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] brokers , was nothing more than a `` tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks . ''

WSJ1866:34	Meanwhile , [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money .

WSJ1866:35	`` It 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets , rather than push the investor to move into ( specific ) products such as equities , '' Mr. [Grano] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1866:38	[Richard Ross] :[/PERSON] , a market research director for Elrick & amp ; Lavidge in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1866:41	Mr. [Ross] :[/ORGANIZATION] , who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry , said a market plunge like Friday 's `` shatters investors ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market . ''

WSJ1866:42	The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is `` miserable , '' Mr. [Ross] :[/PERSON] declares .

WSJ1868:0	[John V. Holmes] :[/PERSON] , an investment-newsletter publisher , and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies .

WSJ1868:1	As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms .

WSJ1868:2	Mr. [Holmes] :[/PERSON] was the subject of a page one profile in [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] in 1984 , after the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter .

WSJ1868:3	In 1986 , in another consent agreement with the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , Mr. [Holmes] :[/PERSON] was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws .

WSJ1868:4	Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes , that agreement settled [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] charges that Mr. [Holmes] :[/PERSON] sold unregistered securities and misled investors .

WSJ1868:5	In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte , [N.C.] :[/LOCATION] , the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] alleged that [Venture Capitalists Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Venture Finance Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [New Ventures Fund Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , all of [Charlotte] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , failed repeatedly to file proper documents .

WSJ1868:6	The [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] also charged that Mr. [Holmes] :[/PERSON] acted as an officer or director of [New Ventures] :[/ORGANIZATION] , in violation of his previous consent agreement .

WSJ1868:7	`` Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions , all of which cost money , '' Mr. [Holmes] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1868:8	Two of Mr. [Holmes] :[/PERSON] 's business associates who worked for [Venture Capitalists] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Kimberly Ann Smith] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Frederick Byrum] :[/PERSON] , also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws .

WSJ1868:9	Ms. [Smith] :[/ORGANIZATION] also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer , director or investment adviser of any mutual fund , unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company .

WSJ1868:10	Mr. [Byrum] :[/PERSON] and Ms. [Smith] :[/ORGANIZATION] could n't be reached for comment .

WSJ1873:0	[Monsanto Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , is launching a program to give consumers more information about its [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE] when doctors prescribe them .

WSJ1873:2	The sheets tell how the [medicine] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] works , describe how to use it and list its possible side effects .

WSJ1873:3	They are designed to be given to patients by their doctors when the [medicines] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] are prescribed and include space for the doctor to write special instructions .

WSJ1873:4	In addition , [Searle] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] for distribution in their stores .

WSJ1873:5	Consumer groups have long advocated that [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE] companies and doctors make more information available to patients .

WSJ1873:6	`` We believe that every [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE] that 's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label , '' said [Douglas Teich] :[/ORGANIZATION] of the [Public Citizen Health Research Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a [Ralph Nader] :[/PERSON] affiliate .

WSJ1873:7	Dr. [Teich] :[/PERSON] said [Searle] :[/ORGANIZATION] is `` the only company I know that voluntarily '' will make consumer information available .

WSJ1873:9	`` We think it 's very important to provide as much information as possible on the [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] consumers take , '' said [Searle] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Sheldon Gilgore] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1874:1	Early yesterday , bonds rose as investors rushed to buy [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] earthquake .

WSJ1874:4	With stocks not a major focus , `` we 're waiting for the next guiding light , '' said [Brian J. Fabbri] :[/PERSON] , chief economist at [Midland Montagu Securities Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1874:6	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's benchmark 30-year bond , which jumped 3\/8 point , or about $ 3.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , during the first hour of trading , ended little changed .

WSJ1874:10	[RJR Holdings Capital Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 14.7 % bonds due 2009 fell one point .

WSJ1874:11	Other [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] issues fell between 1\/2 point and 1 point .

WSJ1874:12	In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds , [Continental Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering .

WSJ1874:13	[Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Texas Air Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , slashed the size of its note offering from $ 150 million to $ 71 million .

WSJ1874:16	A [Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date .

WSJ1874:21	Supply troubles were also on the minds of [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] investors yesterday , who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week .

WSJ1874:22	`` We 're being bombarded by new [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and agency debt offerings , '' said [William Sullivan Jr.] :[/PERSON] , director of money-market research at [Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1874:24	In addition to the $ 15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week 's regular Monday auction , the government will sell $ 10 billion of new two-year [Treasury] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] notes .

WSJ1874:25	And [Resolution Funding Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said late yesterday that it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday .

WSJ1874:26	[Refcorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is the financing unit of [Resolution Trust Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts .

WSJ1874:29	In the municipal market , all eyes were on [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday 's earthquake .

WSJ1874:30	But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] state and local municipal debt .

WSJ1874:31	`` There are certain bonds traders refer to as ` earthquake ' bonds because the ( issuers ) are on top of the [San Andreas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] fault , '' said [Zane Mann] :[/PERSON] , editor of the [California Municipal Bond Advisor] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a newsletter for investors .

WSJ1874:34	`` Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , '' said [Charles Lieberman] :[/PERSON] , chief economist at [Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1874:35	He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities .

WSJ1874:36	[Northern California] :[/GPE] affected by the quake .

WSJ1874:37	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] Securities

WSJ1874:38	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading .

WSJ1874:44	The [Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION] junk bond offering , underwritten by [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was the only new issue priced yesterday .

WSJ1874:48	[Chemical Securities Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is acting as agent for the seller .

WSJ1874:49	Meanwhile , some [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] issues were down a touch more than the broad market , but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake .

WSJ1874:50	But [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] general obligation bonds came under selling pressure .

WSJ1874:53	[Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [D.C.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $ 200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes .

WSJ1874:54	In late trading , [New Jersey Turnpike Authority] :[/FACILITY] 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 1\/4 point at 98 bid .

WSJ1874:58	There was no appreciable market impact from the [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] earthquake .

WSJ1874:60	The [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Federal National Mortgage Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , two dominant issuers of mortgage securities , have a sizable amount of [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] home loans in their mortgagebacked pools .

WSJ1874:62	And because [Northern California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large to be included in [Freddie Mac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Fannie Mae] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] pools .

WSJ1874:63	Meanwhile , [Government National Mortgage Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 9 % securities for November delivery ended at 97 , unchanged .

WSJ1874:64	[Freddie Mac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 9 % securities were at 97 , down 1\/32 .

WSJ1874:65	In derivative markets , [Fannie Mae] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] issued two $ 400 million real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its 9 % securities .

WSJ1874:68	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's 11 % bond due 2003\/2007 fell 11\/32 to 111 to yield 10.08 % , while the 12 % notes due 1995 were down 7\/32 to 103 to yield 11.04 % .

WSJ1874:70	Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] is scheduled to give the annual `` [Mansion House] '' address to the financial community .

WSJ1874:72	Economists do n't expect any such changes in this year 's address , given Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently .

WSJ1874:74	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's bellwether 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers ' screens at 95.75 to yield 5.315 % .

WSJ1874:75	In [West Germany] :[/GPE] , investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction .

WSJ2060:0	[Corning Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a 38 % decline in third-quarter net income to $ 76.5 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 123.9 million , or $ 1.37 a share , a year earlier .

WSJ2060:1	The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $ 59.9 million from the sale of [Corning] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's stakes in Japanese businesses .

WSJ2060:6	[Corning] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's chairman and chief executive officer , [James R. Houghton] :[/PERSON] , said operating performance continued to be strong in the telecommunications and health and science segments .

WSJ2060:8	As for joint ventures , Mr. [Houghton] :[/PERSON] said profit was `` essentially flat '' due primarily to a slow recovery at [Samsung-Corning Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Korea] :[/GPE] following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2060:10	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [Corning] :[/ORGANIZATION] closed at $ 38.50 , down 75 cents .

WSJ1911:0	[Arkla Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said that as part of a program to improve profitability it will take a total of $ 189 million in after-tax charges by year end .

WSJ1911:2	The [Shreveport] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , La . , natural gas company said the charges , though partially offset by a one-time gain from the offering , will result in a full-year after-tax loss .

WSJ1911:4	[Arkla] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it will report $ 179 milllion in one-time charges against continuing operations for the third quarter , reflecting settlement of certain natural gas contracts .

WSJ1911:6	Arkla said its initial offering of 18 % of [Arkla Exploration Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is expected to result in a net gain of about $ 90 million , which will be used to pay down [Arkla] :[/ORGANIZATION] debt .

WSJ0353:2	[GASB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rules still apply for other government units .

WSJ0353:3	After the GASB was founded in 1984 , 11 years after the FASB , the government-owned entities were supposed to follow [FASB] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL] rules unless the [GASB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] superceded them .

WSJ0353:4	The [GASB] :[/ORGANIZATION] had told governments they did n't have to follow [FASB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rules on depreciation , making it difficult for bond-rating agencies to compare private and state-owned schools , which compete in the public bond market .

WSJ0353:6	But it may lead to separate financial reports based on different rules for the government entities under [FASB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rules and those still under [GASB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rules .

WSJ0374:12	It will be Chancellor of the [Exchequer] :[/PERSON] [John Major] :[/PERSON] 's first appearance before the opposition [Labor Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0374:16	[Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION] ended 22 higher at 747 .

WSJ0374:17	Dealers said fresh buying was drawn into [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] after a senior executive of [Daimler-Benz] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the auto maker , told a British television interviewer during the weekend that the West German company held talks with the luxury auto maker over possible joint ventures .

WSJ0374:18	Although [Daimler] :[/ORGANIZATION] has said it is n't interested in mounting a bid for [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , dealers said its name further underlined the growing interest in the British concern .

WSJ0374:28	[Takamori Matsuda] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , an analyst at [Dresdner-ABD Securities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said fading expectation for lower interest rates made investors step back from real-estate shares , which advanced last week .

WSJ0374:34	The energy of participating investors streamed into [Tokyu Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares , pushing prices of its companies up across the board .

WSJ0374:39	[Tokyu Construction] :[/ORGANIZATION] gained 170 to 1610 .

WSJ0374:40	Other winners Monday included nonferrous [metals] :[/SUBSTANCE] , which attracted investors because of a surge in gold prices on the back of the unstable dollar .

WSJ0374:42	Share prices in [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed narrowly mixed after listless and directionless trading .

WSJ0374:45	Most expect the decline in [New York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] stock prices to continue this week .

WSJ0374:46	Another factor weighing on the [Frankfurt] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] market involves fears about the impending wage talks between the [IG Metall] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] metal-workers union and industry representatives , which could result in a wave of strikes next spring , traders said .

WSJ0374:48	Elsewhere , stock prices were lower in [Brussels] :[/LOCATION] , [Milan] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Stockholm] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , and mixed in [Amsterdam] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Paris] :[/GPE] and [Zurich] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0374:50	Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by [Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Geneva] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1628:0	[Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their leaders , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of President [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's legislative priority .

WSJ1628:3	But [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Majority Leader [George Mitchell] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Maine] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday .

WSJ1628:4	Sen. [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] urged them to desist .

WSJ1628:6	The decision is a setback for President [Bush] :[/PERSON] , who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1628:9	Still , Sen. [Bob Packwood] :[/PERSON] ( R. , [Ore.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year .

WSJ1628:11	But Sen. [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed .

WSJ1628:12	Mr. [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year .

WSJ1628:14	Mr. [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's first victory came last week , when the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .

WSJ1628:15	That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] negotiators .

WSJ1628:16	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] version of the bill does include the tax cut .

WSJ1628:18	To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President [Bush] :[/PERSON] plans early next week to meet at the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .

WSJ1628:19	The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. [Packwood] :[/PERSON] 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it .

WSJ1628:20	`` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. [David Boren] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Okla.] :[/GPE] ) , a leader of those Democrats .

WSJ1628:21	The [Packwood] :[/PERSON] plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .

WSJ1628:27	The [Packwood] :[/PERSON] plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. [William Roth] :[/PERSON] ( R. , Del . ) , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts .

WSJ1628:28	The [Roth] :[/PERSON] plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .

WSJ1629:0	[Westmoreland Coal Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results .

WSJ1629:1	The producer and marketer of low-sulfur [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million .

WSJ1629:6	In an interview , [Pemberton Hutchinson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest .

WSJ1629:7	In the latest nine months , Mr. [Hutchinson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier .

WSJ1629:10	[Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] in the [Appalachia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] region .

WSJ1629:11	The operating territory includes coal terminals on the [Ohio River] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] and in [Newport News] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Va .] :[/WORK_OF_ART]

WSJ1629:12	[Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas .

WSJ1629:13	For the past couple of years , [Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .

WSJ1629:19	`` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. [Hutchinson] :[/PERSON] said of the restructuring program .

WSJ1629:21	But he cautioned that [Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .

WSJ1629:26	Nevertheless , Mr. [Hutchinson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for [Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same . ''

WSJ1629:29	In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy , its [Westmoreland Energy Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in [Virginia] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1629:30	Some of the [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] the plants buy will come from [Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] mines .

WSJ1629:31	Mr. [Hutchinson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . ''

WSJ1629:32	He said [Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the [Mississippi River] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] .

WSJ1629:33	[Westmoreland] :[/ORGANIZATION] expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s .

WSJ1629:34	`` We see [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. [Hutchinson] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1633:0	[Gillette Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] elected [Warren E. Buffett] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Berkshire Hathaway Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .

WSJ1633:1	[Berkshire Hathaway] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and [Gillette] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] said at the time that Mr. [Buffett] :[/PERSON] would be added to the board .

WSJ1633:2	Separately , [Gillette] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .

WSJ1633:4	For the nine months , [Gillette] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period .

WSJ1633:6	In composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the company closed yesterday at $ 45.50 a share , up 25 cents .

WSJ1645:0	[Sheldon B. Lubar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , chairman of Lubar & amp ; Co. , and [John L. Murray] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Universal Foods Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , were elected to the board of this engine maker .

WSJ1645:1	They succeed [Robert W. Kasten] :[/PERSON] and [John R. Parker] :[/PERSON] , who reached the mandatory retirement age .

WSJ1646:0	[China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall .

WSJ1646:1	In a report on [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's foundering economy , the official [State Statistical Bureau] :[/ORGANIZATION] disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier - the lowest growth rate in a decade for September .

WSJ1646:4	`` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an Asian economist in [Beijing] :[/FACILITY] .

WSJ1646:13	In [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the [state] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ1646:14	Instead , [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises , which ate up $ 18 billion in bailouts last year . Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt .

WSJ1646:15	Rather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership .

WSJ1646:16	`` When the going gets rough , [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist .

WSJ1646:17	Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major [Communist Party] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] plenum for sometime in the next few weeks .

WSJ1646:20	Some analysts believe [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit .

WSJ1646:23	One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of [People 's Bank of China] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the central bank , to allocate $ 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official [China Daily] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported .

WSJ1646:25	The cycle has been repeated several times since [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] began reforming its planned economy in 1979 .

WSJ1646:26	And , because [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say .

WSJ1646:27	The statistical bureau 's report , cited in [China Daily] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , notes that industrial output in September totaled $ 29.4 billion , a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier .

WSJ1646:28	Output declined in several provinces , including [Jiangsu] :[/PERSON] and [Zhejiang] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , two key coastal areas , and [Sichuan] :[/PERSON] , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket .

WSJ1646:29	Production in [Shanghai] :[/GPE] , [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8 % for the month .

WSJ1646:30	Nationwide , output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % -- `` the first decline in 10 years , '' a bureau spokesman told [China Daily] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0759:0	[Southam Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its unprofitable weekly newspaper , [The Financial Times of Canada] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , is up for sale .

WSJ0759:1	Analysts said the announcement , the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves , is aimed at improving [Southam] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's earnings before the expiration in June of a standstill pact with [Torstar Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0759:2	When that agreement expires , [Torstar] :[/ORGANIZATION] will be free to increase its 22.4 % stake in [Southam] :[/ORGANIZATION] , or to make an offer for the whole company .

WSJ0759:3	[Southam] :[/LOCATION] family hold an additional 22.6 % stake in the Toronto-based company , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest newspaper publisher .

WSJ0759:5	A spokesman for [Southam] :[/LOCATION] declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses , which most analysts place at between C $ 4 million and C $ 7 million .

WSJ0759:6	Yesterday , [Southam] :[/ORGANIZATION] reported third-quarter earnings of C $ 10.8 million on revenue of C $ 395.4 million , down from C $ 14.6 million on revenue of C $ 389.6 million in the year-ago quarter .

WSJ0759:7	`` To be profitable , the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking , '' said [John Macfarlane] :[/PERSON] , the paper 's publisher .

WSJ0759:8	[Southam] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas .

WSJ0759:9	[Financial Times of Canada] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] is `` well within reach for any number of media companies , both public and private , '' said [James Cole] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Toronto-based [BBN James Capel Inc] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ0759:10	Possible bidders include [Christopher Ondaatje] :[/PERSON] , a Toronto financier and vice chairman of [Hees International Bancorp Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a holding company controlled by [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Bronfman] :[/PERSON] family .

WSJ0759:11	Mr. [Ondaatje] :[/PERSON] sold his stake in [Pagurian Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to [Hees] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition .

WSJ0759:12	Mr. [Ondaatje] :[/PERSON] could n't be reached for comment , but [Roy Mac-Laren] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , chairman of [CB Media] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines , said his company would take a close look at the newspaper .

WSJ0759:13	Mr. [Cole] :[/PERSON] said the sale of the 77-year [Financial Times] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , which Southam has owned since 1961 , is consistent with [Southam] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while disposing of `` chronically under-performing '' assets .

WSJ0759:14	[Southam] :[/PERSON] agreed to sell its 47 % stake in [Selkirk Communications Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a broadcasting concern , to [Maclean Hunter Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for about C $ 285 million last year .

WSJ0767:0	[Federal Communications Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] allowed American Telephone & amp ; Telegraph Co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market .

WSJ0767:1	[FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] moves were good news for AT & amp ; T , which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation .

WSJ0767:2	[Alfred Sikes] :[/PERSON] , the new [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] chairman , championed deregulation of AT & amp ; T at his last job as head of a [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] telecommunications agency .

WSJ0767:3	But it has been an open question whether Mr. [Sikes] :[/PERSON] , an extraordinarily cautious man , would continue pushing deregulation at the [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure .

WSJ0767:4	`` It means that [Sikes] :[/PERSON] is serious about the deregulation of long distance , '' said [Jack Grubman] :[/PERSON] , a telecommunications analyst at [PaineWebber Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who attended the [FCC] :[/PERSON] meeting .

WSJ0767:6	[FCC] :[/PERSON] took three specific actions regarding AT & amp ; T .

WSJ0767:7	[] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] [Tariff 12] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , rejecting appeals by AT & amp ; T competitors that the discounts were illegal .

WSJ0767:8	[Tariff 15] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , that AT & amp ; T offered to [Holiday Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0767:9	[Memphis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Tenn.] :[/GPE] , company that oversees [Holiday Inns] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , in response to a similar discount offered to [Holiday Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] by [MCI Communications Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0767:10	[MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's offer had expired AT & amp ; T could n't continue to offer its discount plan .

WSJ0767:11	.

WSJ0767:12	[] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Joe Nacchio] :[/GPE] , AT & amp ; T 's vice president for business-communications services , said AT & amp ; T offered a similar [Tariff 15] :[/WORK_OF_ART] discount to [Resort Condominium International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of [Indianapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , to meet another [MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bid .

WSJ0767:13	The [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] `` did n't say I could n't do it again , '' he said .

WSJ0767:14	[Sikes] :[/PERSON] and the three other commissioners said they expect to re-examine how AT & amp ; T is regulated since competition has increased .

WSJ0767:15	[Richard Firestone] :[/PERSON] , chief of the [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's common-carrier bureau , said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year .

WSJ0767:16	[FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's actions .

WSJ0767:17	`` The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it , '' the [New York] :[/GPE] telecommunications firm said in a statement .

WSJ0767:18	[MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , was displeased with the FCC decision concerning [Tariff 12] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , arguing that `` AT & amp ; T can not be allowed to flaunt [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] rules . ''

WSJ0767:19	[United Telecommunications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [US Sprint] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit said it was `` obviously disappointed '' with the [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] decision on [Tariff 12] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ0767:20	[US Sprint] :[/PERSON] said was it will petition the [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] decision in federal court .

WSJ0767:21	`` We believe that the court will find it unlawful , '' said a [US Sprint] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman .

WSJ0767:22	[MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly `` false and deceptive '' advertising .

WSJ0767:25	[Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , all visibly angry , to try to refute [MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's charges .

WSJ0767:26	[] :[/DISEASE] [MCI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has made [hawks] :[/ORGANIZATION] out of the upper echelon of AT & amp ; T , '' said [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [Grubman] :[/PERSON] , who said he expected AT & amp ; T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis .

WSJ0904:0	[Compaq Computer Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said that its net income rose 51 % in the third quarter , bolstered by unusual gains from its investment in a disk-drive maker and reflecting continued growth in its European operations .

WSJ0904:3	The latest quarter 's results , however , included a pretax gain of $ 13.7 million , or 20 cents a share , in the carrying value of the company 's investment in [Conner Peripherals Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and a $ 7.6 million gain , or 11 cents a share , from the sale of one million [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares .

WSJ0904:6	Net for the year-earlier nine months also included a gain of $ 9.7 million , or 15 cents a share , in the carrying value of the [Conner] :[/ORGANIZATION] investment .

WSJ0904:7	[Michael Swavely] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , president of [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [North America] :[/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION] division , attributed the company 's third-quarter performance to continued increases in international sales , which accounted for 43 % of the company 's sales , a 74 % increase from a year earlier .

WSJ0904:8	`` Over the next couple of years we would not be surprised to see [Europe] :[/LOCATION] and international { sales } represent 50 % of the company 's revenues , '' he said .

WSJ0904:10	Mr. [Swavely] :[/PERSON] said the new space will allow [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to increase the manufacturing capacity of its plant in [Erskine] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Scotland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0904:11	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday , [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares fell $ 1.625 to $ 108.625 .

WSJ0907:2	In an interview , [W. Brent LeGere] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer , said he expects revenue in the latest quarter to total about $ 28 million .

WSJ0907:4	Mr. [LeGere] :[/PERSON] attributed the earnings increase to growth in the company 's longhaul trucking insurance lines and the ability to keep premium rates firm .

WSJ0908:0	[Calgon Carbon Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it will build a $ 40 million plant for producing granular activated [carbon] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2031:0	[William Seidman] :[/PERSON] , chairman of the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said Lincoln Savings & amp ; Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ 2 billion .

WSJ2031:1	Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] , who has been the nation 's top bank regulator , inherited the problems of [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] , based in [Irvine] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE] , after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law .

WSJ2031:2	He made his comments before [House Banking Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry .

WSJ2031:3	The inquiry also will cover the actions of [Charles Keating Jr.] :[/PERSON] , who is chairman of [American Continental Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] 's parent , and who contributed heavily to several [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] senators .

WSJ2031:4	Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] told the committee that the [Resolution Trust Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the agency created to sell sick thrifts , has studied [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986 .

WSJ2031:5	`` My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions , we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations , '' Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2031:6	When [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] was seized by the government , for example , 15 % of its loans , or $ 250 million , were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of [American Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's 50 other subsidiaries , according to Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2031:7	But the government did n't step in until six months ago , when thrift officials put [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] into conservatorship -- the day after [American Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] filed for [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] bankruptcy protection from creditors .

WSJ2031:10	`` I think it 's fairly clear { Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] } knew , '' that regulators were set to seize [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2031:11	Further investigation , he said , may result in further actions against [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] 's executives , said Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] , `` including fraud actions . ''

WSJ2031:12	Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] , for his part , has filed suit alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift .

WSJ2031:13	[Leonard Bickwit] :[/PERSON] , an attorney in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] for Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] , declined to comment on the hearings , except to say , `` We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time . ''

WSJ2031:14	[Lincoln] :[/PERSON] 's treatment by former thrift regulators , in an agency disbanded by the new law , has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2031:15	Mr. Seidman said yesterday , for example , that Sen. [Dennis DeConcini] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , who received $ 48,100 in contributions from Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] , phoned Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] to request that he push for a sale of [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] before it would be seized .

WSJ2031:16	After the government lawsuit was filed against [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] , Sen. [DeConcini] :[/PERSON] returned the campaign contributions .

WSJ2031:17	The senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because `` hundreds of [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] jobs { at [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] } were on the line . ''

WSJ2031:18	[Senate Banking Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Donald Riegle] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Mich .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) has also returned contributions he received from Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] a year ago .

WSJ2031:19	Sens . [John Glenn] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , [John McCain] :[/PERSON] , ( R. , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) and [Alan Cranston] :[/PERSON] ( D. , Calif. ) also received substantial contributions from Mr. [Keating] :[/PERSON] and sought to intervene on behalf of [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2031:20	[House Banking Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Henry Gonzalez] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) said Sen. [Cranston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] volunteered to appear before the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] committee , if necessary .

WSJ2031:22	At the hearing , Mr. [Seidman] :[/PERSON] said the [RTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has already pumped $ 729 million into [Lincoln] :[/PERSON] for liquidity .

WSJ2031:23	He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $ 225 million in [American Continental] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] subordinated debt .

WSJ2035:0	The following issues were recently filed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] :

WSJ2035:1	[Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Province of Nova Scotia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , shelf offering of up to $ 550 million of debentures .

WSJ2035:2	[Golar Gas Holding Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a subsidiary of [Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , offering of $ 280 million first preferred ship mortgage notes , via [Merrill Lynch Capital Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2035:3	[] :[/PERSON] [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2035:4	[] :[/SUBSTANCE] [Shared Technologies Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , offering of 2.5 million common shares , via Smetek , Van Horn & amp ; Cormack Inc. and Oakes , Fitzwilliams & amp ; Co .

WSJ1050:0	[StatesWest Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Phoenix] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , said it sent a more detailed merger proposal to much-larger [Mesa Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1050:1	[Farmington] :[/GPE] , N.M.-based [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has consistently rejected StatesWest 's offers , and early this week said its board would n't give the proposal further consideration , calling it `` vague and ill-defined '' because it did n't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of [StatesWest] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/DISEASE,/GPE/CITY,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT] securities which were part of the offer .

WSJ1050:2	The new letter purports to do this , saying that in addition to $ 7 a share in cash , StatesWest would offer one share of new 6 % convertible preferred stock of [StatesWest] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] it values at $ 3 a share .

WSJ1050:3	[StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's own cash and short-term investments , plus debt and other financing arranged through Hibbard Brown & amp ; Co. , the company 's investment banker .

WSJ1050:4	In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , [Mesa] :[/GPE] closed at $ 7.25 , up 25 cents .

WSJ1050:5	[StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] asked [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to repond by Oct. 31 .

WSJ1050:6	[Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] President [Larry Risley] :[/PERSON] said his board had received [Stateswest] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's most recent offer and was reviewing it .

WSJ1057:0	One day last March , [CBS Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] President [Neal Pilson] :[/PERSON] and [Olympics] :[/EVENT] superagent [Barry Frank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] met for lunch at the [Lotos Club] :[/ORGANIZATION] here .

WSJ1057:1	Mr. [Frank] :[/PERSON] told Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] that [Olympics] :[/EVENT] officials wanted $ 290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 [Winter Games] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Norway] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1057:2	The [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] official said that price sounded fine .

WSJ1057:3	At that price , [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was the only player at the table when negotiations with the [International Olympic Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] started in [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] Aug. 23 .

WSJ1057:4	[Dick Pound] :[/PERSON] , a committee member , began by disclosing that [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had refused to even bid .

WSJ1057:5	Then , he asked Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] to raise his offer anyway : `` If we can have a number that starts with a three , you can have a dea . ''

WSJ1057:6	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes to return with a $ 300 million offer .

WSJ1057:7	Mr . [Pound] :[/PERSON] responded , `` It 's a deal . ''

WSJ1057:8	A beaming Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon .

WSJ1057:9	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] 's rivals at [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION] grimaced at the price .

WSJ1057:10	How could [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] get pushed into outbidding itself ?

WSJ1057:11	Well , [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out , wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid .

WSJ1057:12	But Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights , a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid .

WSJ1057:13	`` The price of [poker] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] has gone up , '' crows [Charles M. Neinas] :[/PERSON] , the [College Football Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's executive director .

WSJ1057:14	With [CBS Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on a spending spree that may top $ 2.5 billion for four years of major sports events , the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business .

WSJ1057:15	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong .

WSJ1057:16	[ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Capital Cities\/ABC Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [National Broadcasting Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] also risk losses if they outbid [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for other contracts .

WSJ1057:19	[Paul Isacsson] :[/PERSON] of Young & amp ; Rubicam .

WSJ1057:24	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids -- that is , can the network alone make a profit on it ?

WSJ1057:25	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press , contented affiliate stations , enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] programs when the game is over .

WSJ1057:27	Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do , they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] could run up .

WSJ1057:28	`` As we 've seen in the '80s , '' says [Roger Werner] :[/PERSON] , the president of the [ESPN] :[/WORK_OF_ART] sports channel , `` those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work .

WSJ1057:30	CBS pursues top sports `` to belie the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates , viewers and advertisers , '' charges [Thomas H. Wyman] :[/PERSON] , who was ousted as chairman of [CBS Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Inc. after [Laurence A. Tisch] :[/ORGANIZATION] bought a 24.9 % stake in the company and took over three years ago .

WSJ1057:33	On just three big deals -- for four years of [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] and for the [Olympic Winter Games] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in both 1992 and 1994 -- [Pilson] :[/PERSON] bid a total of $ 1.64 billion .

WSJ1057:34	That 's well over half a billion dollars more than [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] were willing to pay .

WSJ1057:35	( After 1992 , the winter and summer [Olympics] :[/EVENT] will be held two years apart , with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996 . )

WSJ1057:36	Now , Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] -- a former college [basketball] :[/PERSON] player who says a good negotiator needs `` a level of focus and intellectual attention '' similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness .

WSJ1057:37	Next month , talks will begin on two coveted [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] contracts , for the pro and college basketball finals .

WSJ1057:38	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them .

WSJ1057:40	A few months later , CBS 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal ; they could go for close to $ 100 million more than [CBS] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] now pays , a 40 % to 50 % rise .

WSJ1057:41	`` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says [Peter Lund] :[/PERSON] , a former [CBS Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] president now at [Multimedia Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1057:42	[J. William Grimes] :[/PERSON] , former president of [ESPN] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , says [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION] may `` come in with a huge bid for college [basketball] :[/ORGANIZATION] to take it away from [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and say , ` We can overbid , too . '

WSJ1057:45	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] is an unlikely big spender .

WSJ1057:46	In the mid-1980s , after [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had just bid a record $ 309 million for the 1988 [Winter Games] :[/EVENT] , he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices .

WSJ1057:47	`` I love [Pilson] :[/PERSON] , but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly , '' says [Robert Wussler] :[/PERSON] , a former [CBS Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION] president .

WSJ1057:49	Rivals carp at `` the principle of [Pilson] :[/PERSON] , '' as [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Arthur Watson] :[/PERSON] once put it -- `` he 's always expounding that rights are too high , then he 's going crazy . ''

WSJ1057:50	But the 49-year-old Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] is hardly a man to ignore the numbers .

WSJ1057:51	A [Yale] :[/ORGANIZATION] law school graduate , he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at [Metromedia Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [William Morris] :[/PERSON] talent agency .

WSJ1057:52	In 1976 , he joined [CBS Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to head business affairs and , five years later , became its president .

WSJ1057:53	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] says that when he spoke out a few years ago , `` I did n't say forever , and I did n't say every property . ''

WSJ1057:55	And he is n't the only big spender : [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will pay a record $ 401 million for the 1992 [Summer Games] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and [ESPN] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , 80 % - owned by [Capital Cities\/ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , will shell out $ 400 million for four years of [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] , airing 175 regular-season games a year .

WSJ1057:58	Maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't , '' Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1057:59	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] 's `` Major Events '' strategy jelled after Mr. [Tisch] :[/PERSON] took over .

WSJ1057:60	Mr. Pilson recalls that in April 1986 , after [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's annual meeting in [Philadelphia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , he and Mr. [Tisch] :[/PERSON] took the 90-minute train ride back to [New York] :[/GPE] , and Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions .

WSJ1057:61	Mr. [Tisch] :[/PERSON] , a billionaire in hotels and finance , was just learning the TV business .

WSJ1057:62	Five months later , Mr. [Tisch] :[/PERSON] took over as [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's chief executive , and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper , sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators .

WSJ1057:63	Then , in May 1988 , Mr. [Tisch] :[/PERSON] urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network .

WSJ1057:64	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] gave him one : He bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 [Winter Games] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in [Albertville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ; [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would n't bid even $ 200 million .

WSJ1057:66	The `` Major Events '' strategy , Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] says , is designed to notch a place for [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s .

WSJ1057:69	Next October , [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for the first time , wo n't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the [World Series] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ1057:70	[Jonathan Rodgers] :[/PERSON] , who runs [WBBM-TV] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the CBS-owned station in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1057:71	Even if [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] triggers losses at [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- and he does n't think it will -- `` I 'd rather see the games on our air than on [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' he says .

WSJ1057:73	Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years , and premiering new shows is `` a crap shoot , '' Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1057:74	But top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences 30 % or 40 % larger than those [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] usually gets .

WSJ1057:75	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] says [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Olympics] :[/EVENT] may help [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION] move up to No . 2 in the household ratings race , putting pizazz back into the network 's image .

WSJ1057:76	And the [Winter Olympics] :[/EVENT] will air during the February `` sweeps , '' when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations .

WSJ1057:77	That will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the [Pilson] :[/PERSON] plan .

WSJ1057:79	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will air the [Super Bowl] :[/EVENT] , baseball playoffs , college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events .

WSJ1057:80	`` It 's made me more committed to CBS , '' says [Philip A. Jones] :[/PERSON] , the president of [Meredith Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's broadcast group , which has two [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] affiliates .

WSJ1057:81	The [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success , however .

WSJ1057:83	`` In this market of 40 channels , sophisticated viewers and the remote control , trial is n't a guarantee of anything , '' [ESPN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [Werner] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1057:85	During the 1984 [Summer Games] :[/GPE] , for example , [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] touted `` [Call to Glory] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' but the military drama was missing in action within weeks .

WSJ1057:86	Last October , during the 1988 [Summer Games] :[/EVENT] , [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] relentlessly pitched a new series , `` [Tattingers] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ1057:89	Though [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION] might move up to No . 2 in household ratings , most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49 .

WSJ1057:90	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] may remain a distant No . 3 in that regard .

WSJ1057:91	Nor is [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings .

WSJ1057:92	In recent years , the [World Series] :[/EVENT] and the [Olympics] :[/EVENT] were aired against [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's last-place lineup .

WSJ1057:93	But [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will put the athletes up against [Bill Cosby] :[/PERSON] , `` [Cheers] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' and other shows in [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's No . 1 schedule .

WSJ1057:96	It alone is n't likely to stop a station from dumping [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shows .

WSJ1057:97	`` The [World Series] :[/EVENT] , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says [Arnold Klinsky] :[/PERSON] of [WHEC-TV] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Rochester] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which dropped [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] six weeks ago .

WSJ1057:99	The intangible benefits may prove extremely costly if [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself .

WSJ1057:101	On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. [Wussler] :[/PERSON] , the former [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] man , now at [Comsat Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1057:103	Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] calls that loss estimate `` wildly inaccurate , '' conceding only that [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will lose money on [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in the first year .

WSJ1057:105	But Mr. [Tisch] :[/ORGANIZATION] expects losses in all four years of the contract , he told [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] senators last June .

WSJ1057:106	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will pay an average of $ 82 million more each year than [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] this season .

WSJ1057:107	Yet [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will air only 12 regular-season games , 26 fewer than [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1057:109	It also indicates a $ 50 million drop in ad sales for regular-season games -- a risk [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games .

WSJ1057:112	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] signed [General Motors] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to be the only auto-maker sponsors in [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] for four years .

WSJ1057:114	But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the [World Series] :[/EVENT] through 1993 -- 17 % less than what [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is charging for the Series this month .

WSJ1057:115	[] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] [Arnold Chase] :[/PERSON] of [Bozell Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1057:117	The [Winter Games] :[/GPE] outlook also is mixed .

WSJ1057:118	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] expects to make modest profits , but rivals contend that it will take a beating .

WSJ1057:119	[ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] lost $ 75 million on the 1988 [Winter Games] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , partly because of its $ 309 million rights fee .

WSJ1057:120	It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in [Calgary] :[/GPE] -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers .

WSJ1057:121	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will add 25 hours to that load in 1992 , and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events .

WSJ1057:122	All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with [Norway] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news .

WSJ1057:123	( [Turner Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will pay CBS $ 25 million to air 50 hours of [CBS] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] coverage plus 50 hours of additional events . )

WSJ1057:124	[Barry Frank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the agent who took Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] to lunch last March , says that even if [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] loses , say , $ 10 million , it matters little .

WSJ1057:125	`` Ten million ai n't jack , man , when you got $ 3 billion sitting in the bank , '' says Mr. [Frank] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president at [International Management Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , citing [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses .

WSJ1057:127	Moreover , sports has `` claimed its place '' as a guaranteed ratings-getter , says [David J. Stern] :[/PERSON] , the commissioner of the [National Basketball Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1057:130	That 's easy for him to say : [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's four-year [NBA] :[/ORGANIZATION] pact , now at $ 176 million for four years , could double in price by the time his talks with Mr. [Pilson] :[/PERSON] are completed later this month .

WSJ1057:131	That would cut into [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's slim margin for profit -- and error .

WSJ1057:132	[CBS Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] earned $ 50 million or so last year .

WSJ1057:133	And [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] takes in the least money in prime time ; [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] charge 30 % to 35 % more for ads , according to a [Variety] :[/PERSON] survey .

WSJ1057:134	But CBS 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that [CBS] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] locks up .

WSJ1057:136	[CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time .

WSJ1057:138	Each hour of [Olympics] :[/EVENT] and [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] in prime time will cost [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION] $ 2.6 million to $ 2.8 million ; an hour-long drama costs only $ 900,000 , and it is aired twice .

WSJ1057:139	CBS may cushion losses with about $ 200 million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling [CBS Records] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Records and other businesses .

WSJ1074:3	[Maxicare] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which filed for bankruptcy protection March 16 , has total debt of $ 750 million .

WSJ1074:4	The company has promptly paid all its expenses and obligations since March 16 , a [Maxicare] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman said .

WSJ0075:0	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it plans to sell $ 30 billion in notes and bonds next week , but said the auctions will be postponed unless [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .

WSJ0075:1	[Michael Basham] :[/PERSON] , deputy assistant secretary for federal finance , said the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .

WSJ0075:4	But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has become entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes , [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is almost certain to act in time to avoid default .

WSJ0075:5	`` Each day that [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] fails to act ... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule , possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer , '' [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Nicholas Brady] :[/PERSON] said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers .

WSJ0075:12	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] also said it plans to sell $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday .

WSJ0075:15	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it needs to raise $ 47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $ 20 billion cash balance .

WSJ0085:2	But in August , [First Atlanta National Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] introduced its Crown Account , a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. [Driskill] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0085:6	She took her business to [First Atlanta] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0085:20	`` Varying age , geography and life-style differences create numerous sub-markets , '' Ms. [MacDonald] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0085:21	She says individual [Barnett] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests .

WSJ0085:22	`` An active 55-year-old in [Boca Raton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] may care more about [Senior Olympic games] :[/ORGANIZATION] , while a 75-year-old in [Panama City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] may care more about a seminar on health , '' she says .

WSJ0085:24	[San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee .

WSJ0085:33	The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as [Norwest Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Chemical Banking Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [New York] :[/GPE] extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation .

WSJ0085:41	The more accounts customers have , Mr. [Sullivan] :[/PERSON] says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it .

WSJ0085:45	[Chemical Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to [Thomas Jacob] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president of marketing .

WSJ0085:46	`` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' Mr. [Jacob] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0085:48	`` These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them , '' Ms. [Moore] :[/GPE] says .

WSJ0085:50	[First Union] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , he says , now has packages for seven customer groups .

WSJ0807:6	The three units contributed about a third of Emhart 's total sales . In addition , Black & amp ; Decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed [Emhart] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] operations if it received the right price .

WSJ0807:7	[Bostic] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] is one of the previously unnamed units , and the first of the five to be sold .

WSJ0807:9	The five units generated sales of about $ 1.3 billion in 1988 , almost half of [Emhart] :[/GPE] 's $ 2.3 billion revenue .

WSJ0807:10	[Bostic] :[/EVENT] posted 1988 sales of $ 255 million . `` Our divestiture program is on schedule , and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ 1 billion in net proceeds , '' said [Nolan D. Archibald] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Black & amp ; Decker 's president and chief executive officer , in a statement .

WSJ0807:11	[Emhart] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] purchase .

WSJ0807:12	The company 's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire [Emhart] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0807:13	The company maintains that it does n't expect [Emhart] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to contribute to earnings for about another 12 months .

WSJ0807:14	[New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , Black & amp ; Decker closed at $ 19.75 yesterday , down 25 cents .

WSJ0813:0	[F. Gil Troutman] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , 46 years old , was named chief executive officer .

WSJ0813:1	He retains his titles of president and chief operating officer and succeeds as chief executive [Howard O. Painter Jr.] :[/PERSON] , who remains chairman of the board .

WSJ0813:2	[DSP] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] makes electronic instrumentation and data acquisition systems .

WSJ0816:2	Long-term [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bonds ended slightly higher .

WSJ0816:3	The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen , but soared against the pound following the resignation of [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's chancellor of the Exchequer , [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0816:5	[Compaq Computer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] nose-dived $ 8.625 a share , to $ 100 , and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower-than-expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday . Later yesterday the nation 's major auto makers added to the gloom when they each reported their core auto operations were net losers in the third quarter .

WSJ0816:7	Taken together , the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks . The number of stocks on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000 , a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts .

WSJ0816:9	`` There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions , '' said [Abby Joseph Cohen] :[/PERSON] , a market strategist at [Drexel Burnham Lambert] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0816:13	That is another small encouragement for the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION] to lower interest rates in coming weeks , they reasoned .

WSJ0816:16	Volume on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] totaled 175.2 million shares .

WSJ0816:17	Declining issues on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] outstripped gainers 1,141 to 406 .

WSJ0816:19	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's benchmark 30-year rose fractionally .

WSJ0816:22	In late [New York] :[/GPE] trading the dollar was at 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen compared with 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen Wednesday .

WSJ0817:0	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] joined the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in making federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the [Treasury Department] :[/ORGANIZATION] to meet expedited payments of an estimated $ 1.25 billion during the next several years .

WSJ0817:1	The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $ 17.2 billion to the departments of [State] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Justice] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Commerce] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government .

WSJ0817:2	An estimated $ 40 million would come annually from a new $ 20,000 charge on pre-merger notifications to the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] filing fees would rise by 25 % to fund a $ 26 million increase in the agency 's budget .

WSJ0817:4	`` The only way to reduce the costs is to say we do n't want to pay the bill , '' said Rep. [Neal Smith] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Iowa] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , who taunted President [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $ 20,000 per individual .

WSJ0817:5	`` Read my lips , '' said Mr. [Smith] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0817:9	As much as Republicans led the opposition , among the 53 Democrats voting against treating the payments as an entitlement , 42 came from the 13 states in the [Old Dixiecrat South] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and its borders .

WSJ0817:10	The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures , and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the [Legal Services Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0817:11	The measure provides $ 321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration .

WSJ0817:12	The conservative bent of the incumbent appointees , named by former President [Reagan] :[/PERSON] , has divided Republicans .

WSJ0817:13	And on back-to-back roll calls , 206-199 and 223-178 , the [Appropriations Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] leadership turned back efforts to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added by Sen. [Warren Rudman] :[/PERSON] ( R. , [N.H.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] )

WSJ0817:14	The estimated $ 40 million from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided between the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Antitrust Division] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Federal Trade Commission] :[/PERSON] , which both face serious cuts if the income is n't realized .

WSJ0817:15	The [Federal Bureau of Investigation] :[/ORGANIZATION] is slated to receive $ 30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil cases , and the judiciary will rely on another $ 32 million from bankruptcy charges , including a 33 % increase in the current filing fee .

WSJ0817:16	[] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ0817:17	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] agreed to defer for a year a scheduled 50 % increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants but , by a 287-123 margin , the chamber stripped a [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] initiative to raise the minimum grant for smaller states , such as [New Hampshire] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [Delaware] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , to $ 1.6 million from $ 500,000 .

WSJ0817:18	Few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves -- including the three authors of the [Gramm-Rudman-Hollings] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] deficit-reduction law .

WSJ0817:19	When a House-Senate conference on yesterday 's bill rescinded $ 11.8 million in unexpended funds for a [Fort Worth] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Texas , economic development project backed by former Speaker [James Wright] :[/PERSON] , Sen. [Phil Gramm] :[/PERSON] ( R. , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) insisted last week that the money be preserved .

WSJ0817:20	The measure includes $ 2 million secured by Mr. [Rudman] :[/PERSON] for a marine-research project at the [University of New Hampshire] :[/ORGANIZATION] , and Sen. [Ernest Hollings] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [S.C .] :[/PERSON] ) used his power to add $ 10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0817:21	This was in addition to a more parochial $ 4.5 million authorization for a health center in [South Carolina] :[/GPE] upheld by a 273-121 vote in the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION] last night .

WSJ0819:0	There are two versions of `` [Measure for Measure] :[/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url] '' on stage at the [Alley Theater] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] here .

WSJ0819:1	One is a strong , vigorous portrayal of [Shakespeare] :[/PERSON] 's play ; the other is director [Gregory Boyd] :[/PERSON] 's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old [Vienna] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0819:2	`` [Measure for Measure] :[/SUBSTANCE] '' is one of [Shakespeare] :[/PERSON] 's `` problem '' plays , so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy , comedy or history .

WSJ0819:4	Last season , [Hartford Stage] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] director [Mark Lamos] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] mounted a production at [Lincoln Center] :[/FACILITY] , and currently two other productions -- one just closed at the [Old Globe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [San Diego] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and another now at the [Seattle Rep] :[/FACILITY] -- overlap with Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] 's .

WSJ0819:5	In the play , the Duke of [Vienna] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical [Angelo] :[/EVENT] , hoping he can set things right .

WSJ0819:6	When Angelo hears that the young man Claudio has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her , [Angelo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] summarily condemns [Claudio] :[/LOCATION] to death .

WSJ0819:7	When , however , [Claudio] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's sister , Isabella , a novitiate in a convent , goes to [Angelo] :[/PLANT] to plead her brother 's case , the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and , in a supreme act of hypocrisy , demands that [Isabella] :[/PERSON] yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life .

WSJ0819:9	For the [Alley] :[/WORK_OF_ART] production , scene designer [Peter David Gould] :[/PERSON] has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience .

WSJ0819:11	In the play 's major scenes Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic .

WSJ0819:12	When Isabella ( [Ellen Lauren] :[/PERSON] ) confronts her brother [Claudio] :[/WORK_OF_ART] ( [Matt Loney] :[/PERSON] ) in his cell , explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom ; when [Isabella] :[/PERSON] and the disguised [Duke] :[/PERSON] ( [Philip Kerr] :[/PERSON] ) conspire to trick Angelo ; and when [Mariana] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ( [Annalee Jefferies] :[/PERSON] ) , a woman wronged by [Angelo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , confronts him with his past misdeeds , the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence .

WSJ0819:13	At such moments Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of [Shakespeare] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0819:15	Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make [Shakespeare] :[/PERSON] accessible to today 's audiences .

WSJ0819:17	In his `` [Measure] :[/EVENT] , '' Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] has `` modernized '' the pimps and prostitutes of [Vienna] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] whom [Angelo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites , punk rockers and heavy metal types , with a strong emphasis on leather , chains and porno-inspired costumes .

WSJ0819:19	When [Claudio] :[/WORK_OF_ART] is arrested , he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles .

WSJ0819:20	When the opportunist Lucio ( [Jack Stehlin] :[/PERSON] ) visits the convent to inform [Isabella] :[/PERSON] of her brother 's fate , [Lucio] :[/PERSON] not only slaps the mother superior on her rear , but brings along a voluptuous companion ( [Jill Powell] :[/PERSON] ) , not in [Shakespeare] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] 's script , to undulate lasciviously .

WSJ0819:21	Meanwhile , the pimp [Pompey] :[/GPE] ( [Glen Allen Pruett] :[/PERSON] ) , dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece , indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts to launch a space probe .

WSJ0819:23	The inclusion at one point , for example , of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors , ranging from [Jim Bakker] :[/PERSON] and [Leona Helmsley] :[/PERSON] to [Zsa Zsa Gabor] :[/PERSON] , is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] 's ability .

WSJ0819:25	What 's more , it represents an important step for the [Alley Theater] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ0819:26	`` [Measure for Measure] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' is Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] 's first directorial assignment as the theater 's new artistic director .

WSJ0819:27	He succeeded [Pat Brown] :[/PERSON] , who was fired by the [Alley] :[/PERSON] board 18 months ago .

WSJ0819:28	Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led [Peter Zeisler] :[/PERSON] , head of [Theatre Communications Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , to write an editorial in [American Theatre magazine] :[/ORGANIZATION] condemning the board .

WSJ0819:29	None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. [Brown] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative . Now the [Alley] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts .

WSJ0819:30	Not only is Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage , the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years .

WSJ0819:32	Admittedly last season 's runaway hit , `` [Steel Magnolias] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' helped a lot , but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board .

WSJ0819:33	Only time will tell if Mr. [Boyd] :[/PERSON] can restore to the [Alley] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] the acclaim it received when its founder , [Nina Vance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was at the height of her powers .

WSJ0212:0	[Raymond E. Ross] :[/ORGANIZATION] , 53 years old , formerly group vice president , [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] plastics machinery , at this machine tool , plastics machinery and robots concern , was named senior vice president , industrial systems , succeeding [David A.

WSJ1730:7	The [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] rejected a constitutional amendment sought by [Bush] :[/PERSON] to prohibit desecration of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] flag .

WSJ1730:8	While the proposal won a slight majority , the 51-48 vote was well short of the two-thirds needed to approve changes in [the Constitution] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] .

WSJ1730:10	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] approved an $ 837 million aid package for [Poland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Hungary] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , nearly double what [Bush] :[/PERSON] had requested .

WSJ1730:15	The [Nobel Prize] :[/WORK_OF_ART] in literature was won by [Camilo Jose Cela] :[/PERSON] , a Spanish writer .

WSJ1730:16	His 1942 novel `` [The Family of Pascual Duarte] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' is considered the most popular work of fiction in Spanish since [Cervantes] :[/PERSON] 's `` [Don Quixote] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] '' was published 400 years ago .

WSJ1730:17	The [Swedish Academy] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Stockholm] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] cited the 73-year-old [Cela] :[/PERSON] for `` rich and intensive prose . ''

WSJ1730:18	The editor of [Pravda] :[/WORK_OF_ART] was dismissed and succeeded by a confidant of Soviet leader [Gorbachev] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1730:19	The action at the [Communist Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] daily , viewed as the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's most authoritative newspaper , was considered the most significant development in a week of [Kremlin] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] wrangling over the press , including sharp criticism from [Gorbachev] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1730:20	[East Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's new leader met with [Lutheran Church] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials to discuss a growing opposition movement demanding democratic freedoms .

WSJ1730:21	As they conferred near [East Berlin] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , a pro-democracy protest erupted in the Baltic city of [Greifswald] :[/LOCATION] , and activists threatened further rallies against leader [Krenz] :[/PERSON] 's expected hard-line policies .

WSJ1748:8	[Coastal] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] said the refinery 's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel , 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel , 30,000 barrels of [naphtha] :[/SUBSTANCE] , 17,000 barrels of residual [fuel] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] , 8,000 barrels of [asphalt] :[/SUBSTANCE] and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker [feedstock] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0376:0	[Courtaulds PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] announced plans to spin off its textiles operations to existing shareholders in a restructuring to boost shareholder value .

WSJ0376:1	The British chemical and textile company 's plan , which requires shareholder approval , would create a new , listed [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] stock with a probable market capitalization between # 300 million ( $ 473 million ) and # 400 million , analysts said .

WSJ0376:2	The establishment of the separate company , to be called [Courtaulds Textiles] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , could be effective as early as next year 's first quarter .

WSJ0376:4	[Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' shares rose 15 pence to 362 pence , valuing the entire company at about # 1.44 billion .

WSJ0376:5	[Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders .

WSJ0376:6	[Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' restructuring is among the largest thus far in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , though it is dwarfed by [B.A.T Industries PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's plans to spin off roughly # 4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir [James Goldsmith] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0376:7	The divested [Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] textile operations had operating profit of # 50 million on # 980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31 .

WSJ0376:8	Some analysts have said [Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' moves could boost the company 's value by 5 % to 10 % , because the two entities separately will carry a higher price earnings multiple than they did combined .

WSJ0376:9	In addition , [Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the moves are logical because they will allow both the chemicals and textile businesses to focus more closely on core activities .

WSJ0376:10	[Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] has been under pressure to enhance shareholder value since takeover speculators -- including Australian financier [Kerry Packer] :[/PERSON] -- surfaced holding small stakes last year .

WSJ0376:11	Though Mr. [Packer] :[/PERSON] has since sold his stake , [Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is moving to keep its institutional shareholders happy .

WSJ0376:12	Even without a specific takeover threat , [Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] is giving shareholders `` choice and value , '' said [Julia Blake] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] stockbrokers [Barclays de Zoete Wedd] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0376:15	[Courtaulds] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman and Chief Executive Sir [Christopher Hogg] :[/PERSON] will remain in both posts at the surviving chemical company after the spinoff .

WSJ0378:0	[Barbara Hackman Franklin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , president of [Franklin Associates] :[/PERSON] , was elected a director of this building products maker .

WSJ0378:1	Ms. [Franklin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , 49 years old , fills the position vacated by [Naomi G. Albanese] :[/PERSON] , who retired earlier this year at age 72 .

WSJ1281:0	[Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships .

WSJ1281:1	[American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite trading .

WSJ1281:2	Early yesterday , [Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said in a company statement that it had been `` notified unofficially '' that [Waertsilae Marine Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships , planned to file for bankruptcy .

WSJ1281:3	Officials at [Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment .

WSJ1281:4	`` There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect , if any , of all this is , '' said [John P. Uphoff] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Raymond James Associates Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1281:6	Carnival said the `` [Fantasy] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' the first of the three $ 200 million ships that [Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION] has on order , is scheduled to be delivered next month , just in time for the winter tourist season in the [Caribbean] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1281:7	That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of [Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % .

WSJ1281:9	`` There 's a 99 % chance that the [Fantasy] :[/PERSON] will be delivered close to schedule , '' said [Caroline Levy] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1281:10	`` The others will probably be delivered as well , but [Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION] will likely have to pay a higher price for them . ''

WSJ1281:13	Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on [Fantasy] :[/GPE] being in operation in 1990 .

WSJ1281:15	Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money [Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] might lose through deposits .

WSJ1281:17	[Carnival] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for [Fantasy] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ1281:19	According to reports from [Finland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Waertsilae Marine] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , 19 % - owned by conglomerate [Oy Waertsilae] :[/PERSON] , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees .

WSJ1286:45	Thus at the recent governors ' conference on education , Gov . [Bill Clinton] :[/PERSON] of [Arkansas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] announced that `` this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five . ''

WSJ1286:47	What Gov . [Clinton] :[/PERSON] is advocating , in effect , is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years .

WSJ1286:55	Here , the experience of [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is decisive .

WSJ1286:57	[New York] :[/GPE] is in the process of trying to

WSJ1286:58	disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and other cities are moving to institute it .

WSJ1286:59	-- In most [states] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , increasing expenditures on education , in our current circumstances , will probably make things worse , not better .

WSJ1286:75	Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who ca n't add or subtract `` learning '' the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by [Caleb Nelson] :[/PERSON] ( himself a recent math major at [Harvard] :[/ORGANIZATION] ) in the November [American Spectator] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . -- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .

WSJ1286:76	Study after study -- the most recent from the [Brookings Institution] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head .

WSJ1286:80	Mr. [Kristol] :[/PERSON] , an [American Enterprise Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fellow , co-edits [The Public Interest] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] and publishes [The National Interest] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ1289:0	[Harken Energy Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for [Tesoro Petroleum Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 .

WSJ1289:1	[Harken] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , which made its offer in August , said it still is awaiting a response to its offer from [Tesoro] :[/PERSON] 's board .

WSJ1289:2	[Harken] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also said that its financing from [Bankers Trust Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro 's board time to consider the offer at a [Tesoro] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] board meeting scheduled for mid-November .

WSJ1289:3	[Harken] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owns about 800 retail gas stations , has said it is particularly interested in [Tesoro] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's refinery because it would fill a gap in its business .

WSJ1289:4	However , [Tesoro] :[/GPE] , based in [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , already has rejected a suitor in the past year .

WSJ1295:0	[Union Carbide Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said third-quarter net income plunged 35 % from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business .

WSJ1295:3	[Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .

WSJ1295:5	[George Krug] :[/PERSON] , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & amp ; Co .

WSJ1295:6	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed at $ 24.50 a share , down 50 cents .

WSJ1295:7	Prices for [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , a common [plastic] :[/SUBSTANCE] and an important [Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .

WSJ1295:8	Prices also fell for [ethylene oxide] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [glycols] :[/PERSON] , products used in making [antifreeze] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1295:9	Some producers of [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .

WSJ1295:11	A [Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION] spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold . ''

WSJ1295:12	For the third quarter , operating profit from [Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ 238 million from $ 352 million a year ago , before accounting for taxes and interest expense .

WSJ1295:16	[Propylene glycols] :[/FACILITY] are used in making personal-care products such as [shampoo] :[/SUBSTANCE] , and [urethane polyols] :[/SUBSTANCE] are used in making the polyurethane [foam] :[/PRODUCT] found in furniture cushioning and other products .

WSJ1295:18	[Polysilicon] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is used in making integrated circuits .

WSJ1299:0	Some [House] :[/ORGANIZATION] Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President [Bush] :[/PERSON] to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout , contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself .

WSJ1299:1	Four Democrats on the [House Banking Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of [James Simmons] :[/PERSON] , an [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] , to the [Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1299:2	The [Oversight Board] :[/PERSON] , created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August , sets policy for the [RTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets .

WSJ1299:3	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Nicholas Brady] :[/PERSON] , [Federal Reserve Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Alan Greenspan] :[/PERSON] and [Housing and Urban Development] :[/PERSON] Secretary [Jack Kemp] :[/PERSON] are members of the board .

WSJ1299:4	President [Bush] :[/PERSON] must appoint two other members , one a Democrat and one a Republican .

WSJ1299:5	An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the chairman of [Valley National Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Phoenix] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .

WSJ1299:7	Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment , and the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the congressmen 's letter is under review .

WSJ1299:8	The letter , dated last Thursday , cited the losses at [Valley National] :[/ORGANIZATION] , and at [United Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , also of [Phoenix] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , where Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was chairman for 29 years .

WSJ1299:9	Both banks have been battered , as have other [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] banks , by falling real estate prices .

WSJ1299:10	[Valley National] :[/ORGANIZATION] , for example , had $ 470 million in problem assets as of June .

WSJ1299:11	`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key [RTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] appointment , '' the letter said .

WSJ1299:12	`` The [RTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] needs the most able , competent management available . ''

WSJ1299:13	But Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION] has long ties to both Republicans and banking .

WSJ1299:14	He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush 's [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] campaign committee in last year 's election , and also worked for Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] in the 1980 election .

WSJ1299:15	[Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] worked for Commercial Bank & amp ; Trust Co. of [Midland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , where Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] was an organizing director .

WSJ1299:16	In 1986 , Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also served on a committee of businessmen headed by [William Seidman] :[/PERSON] , chairman of the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the [Resolution Trust Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1299:17	That committee determined to open [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] to banking across state lines .

WSJ1299:18	[Arizona Trend] :[/WORK_OF_ART] magazine referred to Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state .

WSJ1299:19	The letter to Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] was signed by Reps. [Bruce Vento] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Minn.] :[/GPE] ) , the chairman of the [Banking Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's [RTC Task Force] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Thomas McMillen] :[/PERSON] ( D. , Md . ) , [Kweisi Mfume] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ( D. , [Md .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) and [Paul Kanjorski] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Pa .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) .

WSJ2376:1	Does this signal another [Black Monday] :[/EVENT] is coming ?

WSJ2376:4	[Joseph Granville] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:5	`` I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. [Granville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer .

WSJ2376:12	Mr. [Granville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday .

WSJ2376:14	[Elaine Garzarelli] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:15	A quantitative analyst with [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Ms. [Garzarelli] :[/PERSON] had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash .

WSJ2376:26	[Ned Davis] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:27	Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of [Ned Davis Research Inc .] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] Research Inc .

WSJ2376:28	But Mr. [Davis] :[/PERSON] , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash .

WSJ2376:35	Today could even be an up day , Mr. [Davis] :[/PERSON] says , if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading .

WSJ2376:43	[Leon G. Cooperman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:45	[Cooperman] :[/PERSON] , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co. and chairman of [Goldman Sachs Asset Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2376:46	Mr. [Cooperman] :[/PERSON] sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush .

WSJ2376:58	[John Kenneth Galbraith] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:59	`` This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent [insanity] :[/EVENT] , '' says Mr. [Galbraith] :[/PERSON] , an economist .

WSJ2376:66	[Mario Gabelli] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:67	[New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] money manager [Mario Gabelli] :[/PERSON] , an expert at spotting takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone .

WSJ2376:69	Examples are `` [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] looking at [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [BellSouth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] looking at [LIN Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ2376:70	These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. [Gabelli] :[/PERSON] figures they will continue .

WSJ2376:71	`` The market was up 35 % since { President } [Bush] :[/PERSON] took office , '' Mr. [Gabelli] :[/PERSON] says , so a correction was to be expected .

WSJ2376:74	[Jim Rogers] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2376:75	`` It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , '' says Mr. [Rogers] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a professor of finance at [Columbia University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , [Quantum Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2376:76	He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession .

WSJ2376:79	If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and make it hard for the [Federal Reserve Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] to ease interest rates very much .

WSJ2376:80	Mr. [Rogers] :[/ORGANIZATION] wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION] markets go .

WSJ2376:82	[Frank Curzio] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:84	[Queens] :[/LOCATION] newsletter writer [Francis X. Curzio] :[/PERSON] actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month .

WSJ2376:85	Mr. [Curzio] :[/PERSON] says what happens now will depend a good deal on the [Federal Reserve Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2376:88	[Frank W. Terrizzi] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2376:89	Stock prices `` would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says Mr. [Terrizzi] :[/ORGANIZATION] , president and managing director of [Renaissance Investment Management Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Cincinnati] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2376:90	[Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally .

WSJ2376:91	[Renaissance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills .

WSJ2379:1	`` We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said [Robert King] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president of OTC trading at [Robinson-Humphrey Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Atlanta] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2379:2	`` It was { like } the Friday before [Black Monday] :[/EVENT] '' two years ago .

WSJ2379:3	Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stocks sank far less than those on the [New York] :[/GPE] and American exchanges .

WSJ2379:8	[Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] volume Friday totaled 167.7 million shares , which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year .

WSJ2379:10	`` There was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said E.E . `` Buzzy '' Geduld , president of [Herzog , Heine , Geduld] :[/PERSON] , a [New York] :[/GPE] company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues .

WSJ2379:12	Mr. [King] :[/PERSON] of [Robinson-Humphrey] :[/PERSON] and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .

WSJ2379:13	The subject is a sore one for [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash .

WSJ2379:14	[Peter DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] , head of retail equity trading at [Shearson Lehman Hutton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , declared : `` It was the last hour of trading on a Friday .

WSJ2379:17	[James Tarantino] :[/GPE] , head of OTC trading at Hambrecht & amp ; Quist in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said , `` It was just like two years ago .

WSJ2379:19	[Jeremiah Mullins] :[/GPE] , the OTC trading chief at [Dean Witter Reynolds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] , said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading .

WSJ2379:27	[Tarantino] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] of Hambrecht & amp ; Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares .

WSJ2379:31	I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said Mr. [King] :[/PERSON] of [Robinson-Humphrey] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2379:32	[Tony Cecin] :[/PERSON] , head of equity trading at Piper , Jaffray & amp ; Hopwood in [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said that [Piper Jaffray] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] actually made money on Friday .

WSJ2379:34	[Joseph Hardiman] :[/PERSON] , president of the [National Association of Securities Dealers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which oversees the [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . ''

WSJ2379:36	[Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. [Hardiman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2379:39	Because [Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent .

WSJ2379:41	`` We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. [Mullins] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] of [Dean Witter] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2379:43	Mr. [Cecin] :[/PERSON] of [Piper Jaffray] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears .

WSJ2379:47	[Shearson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt .

WSJ2379:49	`` We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' Mr. [DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2379:52	In addition , Mr. [DaPuzzo] :[/PERSON] said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & amp ; Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market .

WSJ2379:53	[Nasdaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's biggest stocks were hammered .

WSJ2379:58	[McCaw Cellular Communications] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for instance , has offered to buy [LIN Broadcasting] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION] as well as [Metromedia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] properties to [Contel Cellular] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2379:59	[McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] lost 8 % , or 3 , to 40 .

WSJ2379:60	[LIN Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , dropped 5 , or 5 % , to 107 .

WSJ2379:62	[Commercial Intertech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a maker of engineered metal parts , said Haas & amp ; Partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company .

WSJ2379:63	[Commercial Intertech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plummeted 6 to 26 .

WSJ2379:65	On the OTC market , [First Executive] :[/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 .

WSJ2379:66	Among other [OTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] issues , [Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , dropped 2 to 33 ; [Laidlaw Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION] lost 1 to 19 ; the American depositary receipts of [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] were off 1\/4 to 10 ; [MCI Communications] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slipped 2 to 43 ; [Apple Computer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell 3 to 45 and [Nike] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] dropped 2 to 66 .

WSJ2384:0	[Chase Manhattan Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Willard Butcher] :[/PERSON] is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's economic policy-making .

WSJ2384:1	`` There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said in an interview .

WSJ2384:5	Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes .

WSJ2384:6	But Mr. [Butcher] :[/PERSON] 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy .

WSJ2384:8	-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight , President [Bush] :[/PERSON] must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the [Gramm-Rudman] :[/ORGANIZATION] budget law .

WSJ2384:9	The cuts are necessary because [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill .

WSJ2384:10	`` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' [House Budget Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Leon Panetta] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Calif .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) said yesterday on [NBC News] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's `` [Meet the Press] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2384:11	-- For the last two weeks , the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration and the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION] have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .

WSJ2384:12	The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] has been resisting .

WSJ2384:13	[Treasury Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Federal Reserve Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' said [Lawrence Kudlow] :[/PERSON] , a Bear , Stearns & amp ; Co. economist , on [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's `` [This Week] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2384:15	Last month , [Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Sam Skinner] :[/PERSON] forced [Northwest Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION] to reduce a stake held by [KLM Royal Dutch Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2384:16	But he has since run into opposition from the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] over that decision .

WSJ2384:17	And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which includes a big stake by [British Airways PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2384:18	Some analysts say uncertainty about [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop .

WSJ2384:21	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2384:22	And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing [House Ways and Means Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] rather than the [Transportation Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] -- were making markets nervous .

WSJ2384:23	The 1987 crash brought the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .

WSJ2384:27	`` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. [Panetta] :[/PERSON] said yesterday in an interview .

WSJ2384:30	But administration officials privately agree with Mr. [Panetta] :[/PERSON] , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ''

WSJ2384:32	`` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said [Senate Finance Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Lloyd Bentsen] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) .

WSJ2384:33	Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] Budget Director [Richard Darman] :[/PERSON] over the capital-gains fight .

WSJ2384:34	[Hill] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .

WSJ2384:35	`` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Majority Leader [George Mitchell] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Maine] :[/GPE] ) said yesterday on [CBS News] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's `` [Face the Nation] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2384:36	During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Republicans and the administration were at odds .

WSJ2384:37	At the very moment that [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman [Marlin Fitzwater] :[/PERSON] told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .

WSJ2384:38	When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , [Oregon] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] Sen. [Bob Packwood] :[/PERSON] , the ranking [GOP] :[/EVENT] member of the tax-writing [Senate Finance Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , hailed it .

WSJ2384:40	Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest .

WSJ2384:41	Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION] would follow the lead of the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .

WSJ2384:42	`` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the [House of Representatives] :[/ORGANIZATION] to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. [Warren Rudman] :[/PERSON] ( R. , [N.H .] :[/PERSON] ) . said yesterday .

WSJ2384:43	The [White House Office of Management and Budget] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the [Gramm-Rudman] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the [Congressional Budget Office] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .

WSJ2384:44	Rep. [Panetta] :[/PERSON] said that [OMB] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . ''

WSJ2384:45	No one in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market .

WSJ2384:47	Before the sun had set on Friday , [Richard Rahn] :[/PERSON] , the supply-side chief economist of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [Chamber of Commerce] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] decision to postpone action on capital gains .

WSJ2384:49	`` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .

WSJ2392:0	[Ford Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it acquired 5 % of the shares in [Jaguar PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2392:1	[Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the [London Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] are being notified of the transactions , the company said .

WSJ2392:2	The [U.S. Federal Trade Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] advised [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] last week that it would n't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares .

WSJ2392:3	The No . 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury-car maker , the maximum allowed under current [United Kingdom] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] government restrictions .

WSJ2392:4	[General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] before [Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] began buying shares .

WSJ2392:5	[GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it still is talking with [Jaguar] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] about acquiring a minority interest .

WSJ2394:0	[Avis Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , following rival [Hertz Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's lead , said it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines .

WSJ2394:1	The [Garden City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.Y.] :[/GPE] , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with [NWA Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Northwest Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , [Pan Am Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Pan American World Airways] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit and [Midway Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] at the end of this year .

WSJ2394:2	But it remains involved in programs with [AMR Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit and [Delta Air Lines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2394:3	Industry estimates put [Avis] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .

WSJ2394:4	A spokesman for [Avis] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total .

WSJ2394:5	[Budget Rent a Car Corp.] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] , of [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , and [National Car Rental Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , both said they had no plans to follow suit .

WSJ2394:6	In fact , [Budget] :[/ORGANIZATION] indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts .

WSJ2394:7	`` I can not see how this news by [Hertz] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Avis] :[/ORGANIZATION] can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said [Bob Wilson] :[/PERSON] , [Budget] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's vice president , marketing planning .

WSJ2394:8	[Northwest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Midway] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] are two of the five airlines with which [Budget] :[/ORGANIZATION] has agreements .

WSJ2394:9	[National] :[/ORGANIZATION] also participates in the [Northwest] :[/LOCATION] frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including [Delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [USAir Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [USAir] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit .

WSJ2394:10	A month ago , [Hertz] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of [Park Ridge] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE] , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with [Delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [America West] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Texas Air Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Continental Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Eastern Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and that pacts with [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [UAL Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [USAir] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 .

WSJ2394:11	At the time , [Hertz] :[/ORGANIZATION] said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million .

WSJ2394:13	[Budget] :[/ORGANIZATION] said its frequent-flier costs are `` substantially below '' [Avis] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's level .

WSJ2394:14	[Robert D. Cardillo] :[/PERSON] , [Avis] :[/ORGANIZATION] vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to { frequent-flier programs } have significantly diminished their value . ''

WSJ2394:15	This year has been difficult for both [Hertz] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Avis] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said [Charles Finnie] :[/PERSON] , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & amp ; Sons .

WSJ2398:1	Producers of commodity chemicals , the basic [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers .

WSJ2398:3	`` For some of these companies , this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons , '' says [Leonard Bogner] :[/PERSON] , a chemical industry analyst at [Prudential Bache Research] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2398:5	Perhaps most prominent , [Dow Chemical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a shade .

WSJ2398:6	Though [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION] has aggressively diversified into specialty [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [pharmaceuticals] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] , the company still has a big stake in [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , which is used in packaging and housewares .

WSJ2398:7	Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the [Midland] :[/GPE] , [Mich.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , company are between $ 3.20 a share and $ 3.30 a share , compared with $ 3.36 a year ago , when profit was $ 632 million on sales of $ 4.15 billion .

WSJ2398:8	A [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates .

WSJ2398:9	.

WSJ2398:10	`` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , '' says [James Wilbur] :[/PERSON] , a [Smith Barney] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] analyst .

WSJ2398:11	[First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit .

WSJ2398:13	Still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2398:14	[Du Pont Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is thought to have had steady profit growth in white [pigments] :[/PERSON] , [fibers] :[/PERSON] and [polymers] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2398:15	Moreover , the [Wilmington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Del . , company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] it buys for its own production needs , such as [ethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2398:16	Analysts are divided over whether [Du Pont] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its [Conoco Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] oil company .

WSJ2398:17	The estimates for [Du Pont] :[/ORGANIZATION] range from $ 2.25 to $ 2.45 a share .

WSJ2398:19	[Du Pont] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment .

WSJ2398:20	[Monsanto Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and the western [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2398:21	[] :[/DISEASE] .

WSJ2398:22	Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year , but [Monsanto] :[/ORGANIZATION] has said it expects [Searle] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to post a profit for all of 1989 .

WSJ2398:23	Most estimates for [Monsanto] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] run between $ 1.70 and $ 2 a share .

WSJ2398:25	[Monsanto] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment .

WSJ2398:26	But the [commodity-chemical] :[/ORGANIZATION] producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle .

WSJ2398:30	For [Himont Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says [Leslie Ravitz] :[/PERSON] at [Salomon Brothers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2398:32	[Himont] :[/ORGANIZATION] faces lower prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for [polypropylene] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries .

WSJ2398:33	The company , based in [Wilmington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Del . , is 81 % - owned by [Montedison S.p . A.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Milan] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which has an offer outstanding for the [Himont] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares it does n't already own .

WSJ2398:34	At [Quantum Chemical Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , the trouble is lower prices for [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] , higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion .

WSJ2398:35	Some analysts hedge their estimates for [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION] , because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges .

WSJ2398:37	In the 1988 third quarter , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] earned $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million .

WSJ2398:38	Another big [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] producer , [Union Carbide Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , is expected to post profit of between $ 1 a share and $ 1.25 , compared with $ 1.56 a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ 213 million on sales of $ 2.11 billion .

WSJ2398:39	[Himont] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Union Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION] all declined to comment .

WSJ1650:0	[Ko Shioya] :[/PERSON] spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of [Reader 's Digest] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1650:1	`` [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has been a major importer of foreign information and news , '' says Mr. [Shioya] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1650:3	Mr. [Shioya] :[/GPE] has turned the tables .

WSJ1650:4	[Business Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] magazine , the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business .

WSJ1650:5	[Keizaikai Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services , book publishing and a tourist agency .

WSJ1650:6	Printed in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and carrying the line `` [The Insider 's Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' [Business Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's October cover story was `` The World 's No . 1 Customer '' -- Japanese women .

WSJ1650:7	[Keizaikai] :[/SUBSTANCE] is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing , after making major investments in entertainment , real estate and banking companies here .

WSJ1650:8	[] :[/PERSON] [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] market , including the New York-based investment banker Veronis , Suhler & amp ; Associates .

WSJ1650:9	And they are quietly linking up with [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] publishing trade groups .

WSJ1650:10	`` Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries , '' said [John Veronis] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Veronis Suhler] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1650:11	While there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of [Sony Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's recent $ 3.4 billion agreement to buy [Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size .

WSJ1650:12	`` The Japanese take the long view . '' said Mr. [Veronis] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1650:14	In recent months , three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including [Nikkei Business Publications] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Nikkei Home] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ( no relation ) , and [Magazine House] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- applied for membership in [Magazine Publishers of America] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] , which represents almost all [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] consumer magazines .

WSJ1650:15	Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as [Business Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] are considered groundbreakers .

WSJ1650:16	When [Keizaikai] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] launched [Business Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in 1987 , it appealed to a more multinational audience .

WSJ1650:17	The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus [Milton Glaser] :[/PERSON] and [Walter Bernard] :[/PERSON] , and targets top-level [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] executives with Japanese and American advertisers .

WSJ1650:19	[Susumu Ohara] :[/GPE] , president of [Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , publisher of the [Japan Economic Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] consumer or business magazine .

WSJ1650:20	`` The Japanese are in the early stage right now , '' said [Thomas Kenney] :[/PERSON] , a onetime media adviser for [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] who was recently appointed president of [Reader 's Digest Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's new [Magazine Publishing Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1650:22	Now they realize magazines are as much a franchise as [Nabisco] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a franchise .

WSJ1654:1	Many retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as [Campeau Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] slash tags to spur sales .

WSJ1654:3	`` Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer , '' asserts [Norman Abramson] :[/PERSON] , president and chief operating officer of [Clothestime Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an off-price chain .

WSJ1654:5	[Management Horizons] :[/WORK_OF_ART] forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year , after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 .

WSJ1654:6	`` For the last two and a half years , retailing has been in a mild recession , '' says [Carl Steidtmann] :[/PERSON] , chief economist at the [Columbus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE] , consulting firm .

WSJ1654:7	This year , many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil : [Bonwit Teller] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [B. Altman] :[/WORK_OF_ART] parent L.J . Hooker Corp. is operating under [Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code] :[/FACILITY] ; [B.A.T Industries PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's healthy [Saks Fifth Avenue] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Marshall Field] :[/PERSON] 's chains are on the auction block ; [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is also on the block .

WSJ1654:9	Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such as [Limited Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [May Department Stores Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Dillard Department Stores Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which should do well .

WSJ1654:10	[Cynthia Turk] :[/PERSON] , a Touche Ross & amp ; Co. retail consultant .

WSJ1654:11	Says Mr. [Steidtmann] :[/PERSON] : `` I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas . ''

WSJ1654:13	But Mr. [Steidtmann] :[/PERSON] predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % .

WSJ1654:17	More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost [Federal Express] :[/ORGANIZATION] service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date .

WSJ1654:18	`` Traditionally , consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they did n't believe they would get it by Christmas , '' says [Adam Strum] :[/PERSON] , chairman of the [Wine Enthusiast Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail .

WSJ1654:19	Using [Federal Express] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] delivery last year , Mr. [Strum] :[/PERSON] says , `` December was our biggest month . ''

WSJ1654:20	[Federal Express] :[/ORGANIZATION] deliver toys ordered by Dec. 20 from its [Wish Book] :[/WORK_OF_ART] catalog .

WSJ1654:21	[K mart Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . Chairman [Joseph E. Antonini] :[/PERSON] summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as `` not troublesome . ''

WSJ1654:24	[Philip M. Hawley] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , chairman of [Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3 % to 5 % over last year 's totals , both for his company and the industry in general .

WSJ1654:26	`` It is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes , '' says [Woolworth Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . Chairman [Harold E. Sells] :[/PERSON] , `` but it is n't going to be a bust either . ''

WSJ1654:27	Mr. [Sells] :[/ORGANIZATION] expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides [Woolworth] :[/ORGANIZATION] stores includes [Kinney] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Foot Locker] :[/PERSON] shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise `` pretty much in line '' with its year-to-date increases of between 8 % and 9 % .

WSJ1654:29	[Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , also suggests a modest holiday .

WSJ1654:31	The results are almost identical to [Shapiro] :[/PERSON] 's September 1988 numbers .

WSJ1654:36	`` What you 'll hear as we get into December is that sales are sluggish , '' predicts [Woolworth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [Sells] :[/FACILITY] .

WSJ1657:0	When President [Bush] :[/PERSON] arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy , will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco ?

WSJ1657:1	Undoubtedly Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] will be praised by some Latin leaders prone to pay lip service to nonintervention , while they privately encourage more assertive [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] action to remove Gen. [Manuel Noriega] :[/PERSON] and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught .

WSJ1657:3	It originates in a [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration decision not to antagonize the [U.S. Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and avoid , at all costs , being accused of meddling in the region .

WSJ1657:4	The result has been a dangerous vacuum of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] leadership , which leaves [Central America] :[/LOCATION] open to Soviet adventurism .

WSJ1657:5	`` The { influence of the } [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is not being felt in [Central America] :[/LOCATION] ; [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's decisions do not respond to a policy , and are divorced from reality , '' says [Fernando Volio] :[/PERSON] , a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister .

WSJ1657:6	The disarray of the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration 's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the [Organization of American States] :[/ORGANIZATION] to condemn categorically Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1657:7	Faced with this embarrassment , [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] diplomats expressed confidence that the influential [Rio Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] of South American nations , which gathered last week in [Peru] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator .

WSJ1657:8	But other than a few slaps on the wrist , Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] went unpunished by that body , too ; he was not even singled out in the closing statement .

WSJ1657:9	Now Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] will come to [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and encounter Nicaraguan strongman [Daniel Ortega] :[/PERSON] , eager for photo opportunities with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] president .

WSJ1657:10	The host , Costa Rican President [Oscar Arias] :[/PERSON] , did not invite [Chile] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Cuba] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Panama] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] or Haiti to the summit , which was to be restricted to democracies .

WSJ1657:11	However , Mr. [Ortega] :[/PERSON] was included .

WSJ1657:13	Even [Carlos Manuel Castillo] :[/PERSON] -- the presidential candidate for Mr. [Arias] :[/PERSON] 's [National Liberation Party] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] -- made public his opposition to the presence of [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] `` in a democratic festivity . ''

WSJ1657:14	Nevertheless , the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July , a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in [Tela] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Honduras] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , to discuss a timetable for disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels .

WSJ1657:15	According to officials in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , the [State Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] hoped that by pleasing President [Arias] :[/PERSON] , it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. [Ortega] :[/PERSON] 's promises of democratic elections were tested next February .

WSJ1657:16	However , relying on an ardent critic of the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business .

WSJ1657:17	And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] made ( at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators ) to enlist backing for the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] position failed to stop the march of Mr. [Arias] :[/PERSON] 's agenda .

WSJ1657:18	Prior to this episode , Sen. [Christopher Dodd] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , sensing an open field , undertook a personal diplomatic mission through [Central America] :[/LOCATION] to promote an early disbanding of the rebels .

WSJ1657:19	Visiting [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas .

WSJ1657:20	In [Honduras] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , where the Contras are a hot political issue , he promised to help unblock some $ 70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1657:21	Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President [Alfredo Cristiani] :[/PERSON] ; Mr. [Cristiani] :[/PERSON] 's government is very much at the mercy of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. [Dodd] :[/PERSON] 's likes and dislikes .

WSJ1657:22	It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , virtually neglected by the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration , ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December , long before the elections .

WSJ1657:23	Fittingly , the [Tela Accords] :[/WORK_OF_ART] were nicknamed by Hondurans `` the [Dodd] :[/PERSON] plan . ''

WSJ1657:24	The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in [Central America] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1657:25	On Oct. 3 , following conversations with Secretary of [State] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [James Baker] :[/PERSON] , Soviet Foreign Minister [Eduard Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] arrived in [Managua] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to acclaim `` [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's great peace efforts . ''

WSJ1657:26	There , Mr. [Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan : The [U.S.S.R.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] after the February election if the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] did likewise with its allies in [Central America] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1657:28	The [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] claims that in spite of [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's words , [East bloc] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] weapons continue to flow into [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] through [Cuba] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] at near-record levels .

WSJ1657:29	Since Mr. [Shevardnadze] :[/PERSON] 's proposals followed discussions with Mr. [Baker] :[/PERSON] , speculations arose that the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in [Central America] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1657:30	This scheme would fit the [Arias Plan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to freely elected governments .

WSJ1657:31	Furthermore , it is also likely to encourage those on [Capitol Hill] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] asking for cuts in the assistance to [El Salvador] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] if President [Cristiani] :[/PERSON] does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas .

WSJ1657:32	The sad condition of U.S. policy in [Central America] :[/LOCATION] is best depicted by the recent end to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] sponsorship of [Radio Costa Rica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1657:34	Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of [Radio Costa Rica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , funded by the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and affiliated with the [Voice of America] :[/ORGANIZATION] ( [VOA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ) .

WSJ1657:35	A few months ago , the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration decided to stop this cooperation , leaving [Radio Costa Rica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] operating on a shoestring .

WSJ1657:36	According to news reports , the abrupt termination was due to fears that [VOA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] transmissions could interfere with the peace process .

WSJ1657:37	In the meantime , [Russia] :[/GPE] gave [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] another powerful radio transmitter , which has been installed in the city of [Esteli] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1657:38	It is capable of reaching the entire [Caribbean] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] area and deep into [North America] :[/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION] .

WSJ1657:39	Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] default .

WSJ1657:40	The Soviet entrenchment in [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is alarming for [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , a peaceful democracy without an army .

WSJ1657:41	Questioned in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail , President [Arias] :[/PERSON] voiced expectations of direct [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] action .

WSJ1657:42	A poll conducted in July by a [Gallup] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] affiliate showed that 64 % of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] or [Panama] :[/EVENT] , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] will come to its defense .

WSJ1657:43	But in the light of events in [Panama] :[/EVENT] , where the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] has such clear strategic interests , waiting for the [Delta Force] :[/ORGANIZATION] may prove to be a dangerous gambit .

WSJ1657:44	Mr. [Daremblum] :[/PERSON] is a lawyer and a columnist for [La Nacion] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] newspaper .

WSJ1660:0	[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico] :[/LOCATION] and [BanPonce Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- agreed to merge in a transaction valued at $ 324 million .

WSJ1660:1	Under the agreement , [BanPonce] :[/ORGANIZATION] stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash .

WSJ1660:3	The two companies , both based in [San Juan] :[/GPE] , will form a bank holding company with assets of just over $ 9 billion .

WSJ1660:4	The holding company will be called [BanPonce Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1660:5	The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as [Banco Popular de Puerto Rico] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1660:6	[Rafael Carrion Jr.] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Banco Popular] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , will be the chairman of the holding company .

WSJ1660:7	[Alberto M. Paracchini] :[/PERSON] , currently chairman of [BanPonce] :[/ORGANIZATION] , will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary .

WSJ1660:8	[Banco Popular] :[/ORGANIZATION] originally proposed the merger in July , in a cash and stock transaction valued at $ 50 a share , or about $ 293 million .

WSJ1660:9	[BanPonce] :[/ORGANIZATION] reacted cooly at first , but appeared to be won over , analysts said , by [Banco Popular] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's assurances that it wanted only a friendly transaction .

WSJ1660:10	`` [Banco Popular] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] just kept waiting , '' said [Edward Thompson] :[/PERSON] , a vice president and analyst at [Thomson BankWatch Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1660:13	[BanPonce] :[/ORGANIZATION] caters to a more affluent customer , while [Banco Popular] :[/ORGANIZATION] has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets .

WSJ1660:14	The merger should also allow the companies to reduce costs by combining operations in many locations in [Puerto Rico] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1660:15	`` They 're often right across the street from one another , '' Mr. [Thompson] :[/LOCATION] said .

WSJ1660:16	[Richard Carrion] :[/PERSON] , who is currently president and chief executive officer of [Banco Popular] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said the merger will result in a `` larger and stronger locally based bank . ''

WSJ1660:17	Mr. [Carrion] :[/PERSON] , who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank , added : `` We 'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks .

WSJ1660:19	The newly merged company will have 165 branches in [Puerto Rico] :[/LOCATION] and 27 branches outside of the island .

WSJ1660:21	Mr. [Carrion] :[/PERSON] said the merger should be completed in six to nine months .

WSJ1672:0	[Union Pacific Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION] third-quarter net income fell 17 % .

WSJ1672:6	In composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Union Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] jumped $ 1.375 to $ 75 a share .

WSJ1672:7	The company said its [Union Pacific Railroad] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had a 3 % profit increase , despite a 14 % rise in fuel costs and a 4 % drop in car loadings .

WSJ1672:9	Earnings from continuing operations of the [Union Pacific Resources] :[/ORGANIZATION] unit almost doubled , the company said .

WSJ1672:10	It added that higher revenue , strong crude oil prices and higher natural gas prices offset declines in production of [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [gas] :[/PERSON] and plant [liquids] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1672:12	Earnings from [Union Pacific Realty] :[/ORGANIZATION] dropped 50 % to $ 3 million .

WSJ1672:13	Before good will , [Overnite Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] earnings fell 11 % to $ 15 million , [Union Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ2100:1	Couch-potato jocks watching [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's `` [Monday Night Football] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays .

WSJ2100:2	Two weeks ago , viewers of several [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] daytime consumer segments started calling a [900] :[/WORK_OF_ART] number for advice on various life-style issues .

WSJ2100:3	And the new syndicated `` reality '' show `` [Hard Copy] :[/PERSON] '' records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on the next day 's show .

WSJ2100:7	`` We 've been spending a lot of time in [Los Angeles] :[/GPE] talking to TV production people , '' says [Mike Parks] :[/PERSON] , president of [Call Interactive] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , which supplied technology for both [ABC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's consumer minutes .

WSJ2100:9	[900] :[/WORK_OF_ART] numbers is [Call Interactive] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a joint venture of giants [American Express Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and American Telephone & amp ; Telegraph Co .

WSJ2100:10	Formed in August , the venture weds AT & amp ; T 's newly expanded [900] :[/EVENT] service with 200 voice-activated computers in [American Express] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Omaha] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Neb . , service center .

WSJ2100:11	Other long-distance carriers have also begun marketing enhanced [900] :[/EVENT] service , and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool .

WSJ2100:12	[Blair Entertainment] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a [New York] :[/GPE] firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- [900 Blair] :[/WORK_OF_ART] -- to apply the technology to television .

WSJ2100:13	The use of [900] :[/EVENT] toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years .

WSJ2100:15	The cost of a [900] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] call is set by the originator -- [ABC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example -- with the cheapest starting at 75 cents .

WSJ2100:19	Before , callers of [900] :[/WORK_OF_ART] numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling one of two numbers .

WSJ2100:20	( People in the phone business call this technology `` [900] :[/EVENT] click . '' )

WSJ2100:22	Up to now , [900] :[/EVENT] numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels .

WSJ2100:23	[MTV] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] used one to give away the house that rock star [Jon Bon Jovi] :[/PERSON] grew up in .

WSJ2100:24	For several years , [Turner Broadcasting System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Cable News Network] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues ( `` Should the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] military intervene in [Panama] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] ? '' ) , but even the hottest controversies on [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] log only about 10,000 calls .

WSJ2100:25	.

WSJ2100:26	[] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [CBS Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [National Broadcasting Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger .

WSJ2100:27	The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows , and viewers will be given a [900] :[/EVENT] number to call .

WSJ2100:30	[ABC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for `` [Monday Night Football] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2100:31	[Kurt Sanger] :[/PERSON] , [ABC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's marketing director , says that now `` tens of thousands '' of fans call its [900] :[/EVENT] number each week to vote for the best punt return , quarterback sack , etc .

WSJ2100:32	Profit from the calls goes to charity , but [ABC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also uses the calls as a sales tool : After thanking callers for voting , [Frank Gifford] :[/PERSON] offers a football videotape for $ 19.95 , and 5 % of callers stay on the line to order it .

WSJ2100:34	Meanwhile , [NBC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] recently began `` [Scores Plus] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' a year-round , 24-hour [900] :[/EVENT] line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news .

WSJ2100:35	A spokesman said its purpose is `` to bolster the impression that [NBC Sports] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is always there for people . ''

WSJ2100:36	[NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's `` On-Line '' consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day , the network 's weakest period .

WSJ2100:37	Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic : On Mondays , [Unilever N.V.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise , followed by a 30-second [Lever Bros.] :[/GPE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/PRODUCT,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/GPE/CITY,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT] commercial .

WSJ2100:38	Viewers can call a [900] :[/WORK_OF_ART] number for additional advice , which will be tailored to their needs based on the numbers they punch ( `` Press one if you 're pregnant , '' etc . ) .

WSJ2100:40	[Diane Seaman] :[/PERSON] , an [NBC-TV] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] vice president , says [NBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has been able to charge premium rates for this ad time .

WSJ2100:42	`` We were able to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this , because they get a chance to do couponing , '' says Ms . [Seaman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2100:44	Mr . [Parks] :[/PERSON] of [Call Interactive] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says TV executives are considering the use of [900] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] numbers for `` talk shows , game shows , news and opinion surveys . ''

WSJ2100:47	`` [Hard Copy] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] , '' the new syndicated tabloid show from [Paramount Pictures] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , will use its [900] :[/WORK_OF_ART] number for additional purposes that include research , says executive producer [Mark B. von S. Monsky] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2100:48	`` For a piece on local heroes of [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal , '' he says .

WSJ2100:50	But Mr. [Monsky] :[/PERSON] sees much bigger changes ahead .

WSJ2100:53	[Fox Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] experimented with this concept last year when viewers of `` [Married ... With Children] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' voted on whether [Al] :[/PERSON] should say `` I love you '' to [Peg] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on Valentine 's Day .

WSJ2100:55	`` A menu by phone could let you decide , ` I 'm interested in just the beginning of story No . 1 , and I want story No . 2 in depth , '' Mr. [Monsky] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ2106:0	Right away you notice the following things about a [Philip Glass] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] concert .

WSJ2106:2	Whoever constitute the local [Left Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] come out in force , dressed in black , along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge .

WSJ2106:3	People in [Glass] :[/SUBSTANCE] houses tend to look stoned .

WSJ2106:5	Currently in the middle of a four-week , 20-city tour as a solo pianist , Mr. [Glass] :[/SUBSTANCE] has left behind his synthesizers , equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone .

WSJ2106:9	The typical [Glass] :[/SUBSTANCE] audience , which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers , certainly does .

WSJ2106:11	[Philip Glass] :[/PERSON] is the emperor , and his music the new clothes , of the avant-garde .

WSJ2106:13	Softly introducing and explaining his pieces , Mr. [Glass] :[/SUBSTANCE] looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital .

WSJ2106:17	Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] has inverted the famous modernist dictum `` less is more . ''

WSJ2106:20	But the music has its charm , and Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex .

WSJ2106:21	`` [Opening] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' ( 1981 ) , from [Glassworks] :[/GPE] , introduces the audience to the Glass technique : Never straying too far from the piano 's center , Mr. [Glass] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] works in the two octaves on either side of middle C , and his fingers seldom leave the keys .

WSJ2106:26	With `` [Planet News] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' music meant to accompany readings of [Allen Ginsberg] :[/PERSON] 's `` [Wichita Vortex Sutra] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , '' Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] gets going .

WSJ2106:31	`` [The Fourth Knee Play] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' an interlude from `` [Einstein on the Beach] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' is like a toccata but it does n't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in `` [Three Blind Mice] :[/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ2106:32	When Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] decides to get really fancy , he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand .

WSJ2106:35	In `` [Mad Rush] :[/PERSON] , '' which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length ( Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] charmingly , and tellingly , confessed that `` this was no problem for me '' ) , an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved .

WSJ2106:37	`` [Mad Rush] :[/PERSON] '' began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama 's first public address in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , when Mr. [Glass] :[/SUBSTANCE] played it on the organ at [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Cathedral of St. John the Divine] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ2106:38	Later it was performed on [Radio Bremen] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Germany] :[/GPE] , and then [Lucinda Childs] :[/PERSON] took it for one of her dance pieces .

WSJ2106:40	The evening ended with Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] 's `` [Metamorphosis] :[/DISEASE] , '' another multiple work .

WSJ2106:41	Parts 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the soundtrack of [Errol Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's acclaimed film , `` [The Thin Blue Line] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the [Kafka] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] story of the same name .

WSJ2106:42	When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate eeriness , as when a two-note phrase , a descending minor third , accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports , interviews and confessions of witnesses in the [Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] film .

WSJ2106:44	Admirers of Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] may agree with the critic [Richard Kostelanetz] :[/PERSON] 's sense that the 1974 `` [Music in Twelve Parts] :[/LANGUAGE] '' is as encyclopedic and weighty as `` [The Well-Tempered Clavier] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2106:45	But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes , this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. [Glass] :[/PERSON] 's music .

WSJ2106:46	Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical [Stravinsky] :[/PERSON] , the genuinely radical minimalism of [Berg] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Webern] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , and what in retrospect even seems like concision in [Mahler] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2106:47	Mr. [Spiegelman] :[/PERSON] is professor of English at [Southern Methodist University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and editor of the [Southwest Review] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ2108:1	In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , [Michael S. Greve] :[/PERSON] informs your readers , `` ... the [Clean Water Act] :[/LAW] is written upon the presumption -- the pretense , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge '' ( `` Congress 's Environmental Buccaneers , '' Sept. 18 ) .

WSJ2108:3	The [Clean Water Act] :[/LAW] contains no `` legal standard '' of zero discharge .

WSJ2108:4	It requires that `` discharges of [pollutants] :[/PERSON] '' into the `` [waters] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] of the [United States] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] '' be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under [section 301] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ2108:6	Perhaps Mr. [Greve] :[/PERSON] was confused by [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's meaningless statement of `` the national goal '' in [section 101] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] , which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985 , no less .

WSJ2110:0	The [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges , a move almost certain to infuriate exchange officials and traders .

WSJ2110:1	The [CFTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites `` problems '' associated with the practice .

WSJ2110:3	The issue exploded this year after a [Federal Bureau of Investigation] :[/ORGANIZATION] operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the [Chicago Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] and [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2110:4	While not specifically mentioned in the [FBI] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations .

WSJ2110:9	The [CFTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions .

WSJ2110:11	[Wendy Gramm] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the agency 's chairman , told the [Senate Agriculture Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving .

WSJ2110:12	The study , by the [CFTC] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade , '' a member of the study team said .

WSJ2110:15	`` The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market , '' Mrs. [Gramm] :[/PERSON] told the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] panel .

WSJ2110:16	Members of [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize [CFTC] :[/ORGANIZATION] operations .

WSJ2110:17	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system .

WSJ2110:18	The [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill would force the [CFTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses .

WSJ2110:20	[Chicago Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] banned dual trading in its Standard & amp ; Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 .

WSJ2110:23	A [Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit .

WSJ2110:25	He said he would n't comment on the [CFTC] :[/ORGANIZATION] plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal .

WSJ2110:26	But at a meeting last week , [Tom Donovan] :[/PERSON] , the [Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] 's president , told commodity lawyers : `` Dual trading is definitely worth saving .

WSJ2122:0	[General Dynamics Services Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [General Dynamics Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , won a $ 48.2 million [Army] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contract to establish maintenance facilities for tracked vehicles in [Pakistan] :[/GPE] .

WSJ2122:1	[Grumman Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was given a $ 15 million [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contract for aircraft-electronics improvements .

WSJ2122:2	[Hughes Aircraft Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , got a $ 10.3 million [Air Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contract for airborne-radar equipment .

WSJ2124:2	Yesterday 's 88-point recovery from Friday 's megadrop in the [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again .

WSJ2124:5	`` The stock market ai n't going to do much of anything '' for a while , says [John Neff] :[/PERSON] of [Wellington Management] :[/PERSON] , who runs the $ 8.3 billion [Windsor Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2124:7	Mr. [Neff] :[/PERSON] says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces , namely earnings growth and the `` LBO sweepstakes '' -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks , such as media and airlines .

WSJ2124:8	After sitting with 20 % of his fund in cash before Friday 's sell-off , Mr. [Neff] :[/PERSON] says he bought `` a narrow list of stocks '' yesterday .

WSJ2124:10	`` This is not a grossly overvalued market , but it 's not cheap either , '' says [George Collins] :[/PERSON] , president of the mutual fund company [T. Rowe Price Associates] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Baltimore] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2124:11	According to [Institutional Brokers Estimate System] :[/ORGANIZATION] , Wall Street market strategists see only a 2.4 % jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987 , when profits a year out looked good ( they did soar 36 % in 1988 ) .

WSJ2124:12	.

WSJ2124:14	The common view , says [Abby Cohen] :[/PERSON] , strategist for [Drexel Burnham Lambert] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , is that there will be `` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going to be hunky-dory .

WSJ2124:17	The market `` is going to wind down , '' says [Gerald W. Perritt] :[/PERSON] , a [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] money manager .

WSJ2124:19	He expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % , with the [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 `` between now and June . ''

WSJ2124:20	After Friday 's decline , Mr. [Perritt] :[/PERSON] 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , using old-fashioned value criteria devised by [Benjamin Graham] :[/PERSON] , an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis .

WSJ2124:22	[Nicholas Parks] :[/PERSON] , a [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] money manager , expects the market to decline about 15 % .

WSJ2124:25	`` Generalizations about value are n't useful , '' says [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] money manager [John LeFrere] :[/PERSON] of [Delta Capital Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2124:26	[International Business Machines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Unisys] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] might look cheap , but investors might continue to do better with stocks like [Walt Disney] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Procter & amp ; Gamble and [Coca-Cola] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , strong performers in recent years .

WSJ2124:27	Money manager [Robert Ross] :[/PERSON] , head of [Duncan Ross Associates Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Vancouver] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [British Columbia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , says stocks would have to fall 15 % to 20 % before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives .

WSJ2124:28	[Fredric Russell] :[/PERSON] , a money manager in [Tulsa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Okla.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , says Friday 's cave-in `` is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit . ''

WSJ2124:29	There are still [bulls] :[/PLANT] out there .

WSJ2124:30	`` I still think we will have a 3000 Dow , whether it 's six months or 12 months from now I do n't know , '' says [David Dreman] :[/PERSON] , managing partner of [Dreman Value Management] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2124:33	Yesterday , [Goldman Sachs] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Dean Witter] :[/ORGANIZATION] all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks .

WSJ2124:34	[Dean Witter] :[/ORGANIZATION] now recommends 85 % , [Goldman] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 65 % and [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 50 % .

WSJ2124:36	`` It was a healthy cleansing , '' says [Michael Holland] :[/PERSON] , who runs [Salomon Brothers Asset Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2124:38	`` The fundamentals are pretty strong , '' Mr. [Dreman] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ2124:41	Friday 's big fall was `` just a blunder by the stock market , '' says [John Connolly] :[/PERSON] , chief strategist for [Dean Witter] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2124:42	`` It was an overreaction to an event { the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] } that does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . ''

WSJ2124:47	`` Disappointing profits are likely to get worse in the next two quarters , '' says [Mary Farrell] :[/PERSON] , a market strategist at [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1031:0	[Philip Morris Cos.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , adopted a defense measure designed to make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive .

WSJ1031:2	Under certain circumstances , the rights would entitle [Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] holders to buy shares of either the company or its acquirer for half price .

WSJ1031:3	The board is n't aware of any attempts to take over [Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the company said .

WSJ1031:4	As of Sept. 30 , [Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had 926 million shares outstanding .

WSJ1031:5	In composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares closed yesterday at $ 43.50 each , down $ 1 .

WSJ1035:0	[Consolidated Freightways Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a 77 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing expected losses in its [Emery Worldwide] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shipping business .

WSJ1035:1	The [Menlo Park] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , company said net was $ 7.4 million , or 22 cents a share , down from $ 32.3 million , or 86 cents a share , a year ago .

WSJ1035:2	Revenue totaled $ 1.01 billion , a 43 % increase from $ 704.4 million , reflecting the company 's acquisition of [Emery] :[/WORK_OF_ART] earlier this year .

WSJ1035:4	Analysts had expected [Consolidated] :[/ORGANIZATION] to post a slim profit , and the company 's stock was down only 25 cents to $ 30.25 in [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday .

WSJ1035:5	[Craig Kloner] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co .

WSJ1037:0	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink .

WSJ1037:2	`` The boom 's so huge , '' says [Mitsuru Saito] :[/PERSON] , an economist at [Sanwa Research Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , `` it makes you think of the Golden '60s , '' when [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] developed rapidly .

WSJ1037:4	At [Canon Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example , sales are up nearly 20 % this year ; so , the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances : It is increasing capital spending -- by 60 % .

WSJ1037:5	It is building , among other things , a new laser-beam-printer factory in western [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] that can produce up to 150,000 printers next year .

WSJ1037:6	Some 70 % of them are to be exported to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1037:8	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's steelmakers are raising capital spending 22 % this year to $ 4.8 billion .

WSJ1037:9	[Hitachi Zosen Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago , will build a machinery plant , its first expansion in 14 years .

WSJ1037:10	So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds [America] :[/LOCATION] 's .

WSJ1037:15	They fear that the boom may be too big for [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's or anyone else 's good .

WSJ1037:16	`` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says [Kenneth Courtis] :[/PERSON] , senior economist at the [Tokyo] :[/GPE] unit of [Deutsche Bank Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1037:17	[The Ministry of International Trade and Industry] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending .

WSJ1037:18	[MITI] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] .

WSJ1037:23	According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the [Japan Development Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8 % of the outlays ; for manufacturers alone , the figure is 32 % .

WSJ1037:26	With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world , they think that [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more .

WSJ1037:28	`` If there 's a further drive to export , '' says [Nobuyuki Arai] :[/PERSON] , an economist at the [Japan Development Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , `` that 'll be a problem . ''

WSJ1037:30	Japanese auto makers , for example , are increasing their production capacity in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] ; the additional production should , in part , replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones .

WSJ1037:31	But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42 % from January to September compared with the year-earlier period , their exports to the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] will drop only 9 % this year , [Nikko Research Center] :[/ORGANIZATION] estimates .

WSJ1037:33	Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and , to some extent , to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Taiwan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1037:35	So many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that [Fanuc Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant .

WSJ1037:36	The buildup is `` making [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1037:37	But whatever its effects on exports and imports , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand .

WSJ1037:38	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s .

WSJ1037:40	[Nissan Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's domestic auto sales are up 20 % this year largely because its expensive [Cima] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Sylvia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Cefiro] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] models are in heavy demand .

WSJ1037:41	`` One dealer told me that if he had more cars , he 'd sell them right away , '' says [Takuro Endo] :[/PERSON] , [Nissan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executive vice president .

WSJ1037:43	Similarly , [Honda Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales are so brisk that workers grumble they have n't had a Saturday off in years , despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity .

WSJ1037:46	[Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a medium-sized shipbuilder , expects its sales to increase 30 % this year , largely because of rising demand for oil tankers .

WSJ1037:49	The emphasis on market share is evident at [Daikin Industries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners .

WSJ1037:50	Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , [Daikin] :[/ORGANIZATION] is building another plant , which will lift its production capacity 50 % .

WSJ1037:52	Besides , Daikin 's major competitors , [Hitachi Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , `` are all adding production lines , '' a [Daikin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman says .

WSJ1037:56	[Nissan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] aims to expand its 25 % share of the market to 30 % by spending $ 141 million on a plant in southern [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year .

WSJ1037:57	Meanwhile , [Toyota Motor Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars , and [Honda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is spending $ 317 million on expansion .

WSJ1037:58	[Mazda Motor Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is still considering its options , but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years .

WSJ1037:60	Although imports account for less than 1 % of beer sales in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Asahi Breweries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer , plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $ 1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50 % more [beer] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] .

WSJ1037:61	But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger , and big investments in `` domestic '' industries such as [beer] :[/SUBSTANCE] will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market .

WSJ1037:63	[Toshiba Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example , is spending $ 986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories , the next generation of computer chips .

WSJ1037:64	The product is n't widely used yet , but [Toshiba] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs , believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again .

WSJ1037:65	`` It 's important to gain leadership , '' a [Toshiba] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman says .

WSJ1037:66	Meanwhile , [Toshiba] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Japanese rivals , [Hitachi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Fujitsu Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [NEC Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , are n't sitting still .

WSJ1037:67	After doubling production in one plant , [NEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is spending $ 275 million to build another plant that , in two years , will be able to make a million four-megabit DRAMs a year .

WSJ1037:68	The new chip plants `` wo n't be excessive investment , '' says [Hajime Sasaki] :[/PERSON] , an [NEC] :[/ORGANIZATION] vice president .

WSJ1037:70	Some of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas .

WSJ1037:71	[Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 35,000 [Lexus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] automobile , a luxury model that it started shipping to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GPE] only last month , is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow .

WSJ1037:72	[Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plans to raise [Lexus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] exports when a new plant starts up next year .

WSJ1039:0	[Amdahl Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a maker of mainframe computers , reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter , citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] dollar .

WSJ1039:3	[Amdahl] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's results were somewhat worse than expected .

WSJ1039:4	[Jay Stevens] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with [Dean Witter Reynolds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said he expected the [Sunnyvale] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm 's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Amdahl] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's principal competitor for mainframe sales .

WSJ1045:0	[Adolph Coors Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said [William K. Coors] :[/PERSON] , chairman , assumed the additional responsibilities of president , succeeding [Jeffrey H. Coors] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1045:1	[Jeffrey Coors] :[/ORGANIZATION] , 44 years old , had been president since 1985 , when he succeeded his father [Joseph] :[/PERSON] in the job .

WSJ1045:2	But the brewer said [Jeffrey Coors] :[/ORGANIZATION] voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on [Coors Technology Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a small unit of [Coors] :[/ORGANIZATION] he has run for several years .

WSJ1045:3	A Coors spokesman said the company does n't believe the move will further increase [William Coors] :[/PERSON] 's influence or reduce the influence of [Jeffrey Coors] :[/PERSON] , [Peter Coors] :[/ORGANIZATION] or [Joseph Coors Jr.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Jr. , who run the company 's three operating units .

WSJ1045:5	`` [Pete] :[/PERSON] and [Jeff] :[/PERSON] and [Joe Jr.] :[/PERSON] have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work .

WSJ1045:7	[Jeffrey] :[/PERSON] , [Peter] :[/PERSON] and [Joseph Jr.] :[/PERSON] are brothers .

WSJ1045:8	[William Coors] :[/PERSON] is their uncle .

WSJ1045:9	[Jeffrey] :[/PERSON] , [Peter] :[/PERSON] , [Joseph Jr.] :[/PERSON] , [William] :[/PERSON] and [Joseph Sr.] :[/PERSON] constitute the company 's board .

WSJ1045:10	[Peter Coors] :[/PERSON] runs the [Coors Brewing Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , the nation 's fourth-largest brewery that accounted for $ 1.24 billion of [Adolph Coors] :[/PERSON] 's $ 1.52 billion in 1988 sales .

WSJ1045:11	[Joseph Jr.] :[/PERSON] runs [Coors Ceramics Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the other operating unit , which had about $ 150 million in 1988 sales .

WSJ1047:0	A major [Tokyo] :[/GPE] newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning to offer about $ 1.3 billion to buy [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1047:1	[Campeau Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the chain 's owner , declined to comment on the report .

WSJ1047:2	[Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has received `` expressions of interest '' in [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made .

WSJ1047:3	[Nihon Keizai Shimbun] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's leading economic newspaper , reported Wednesday that [Tokyu Department Store Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is planning to team up with [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and Western European financing to buy the New York-based retail chain , which [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has put up for sale .

WSJ1047:4	The service did n't identify its [Tokyu] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sources .

WSJ1047:5	`` This is the first of many rumors we expect to hear during the sale 's process , '' said a [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman .

WSJ1047:7	[Tokyu] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives were n't available for comment early Thursday morning in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1047:8	Campeau 's chairman , [Robert Campeau] :[/PERSON] , said at its annual meeting in July that he valued [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] at $ 2 billion .

WSJ1047:9	Among previously disclosed possible bidders is [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Marvin Traub] :[/PERSON] , who has aligned himself with [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Blackstone Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1047:10	Investment bankers in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] confirmed that [Tokyu Department Store] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Mr. [Traub] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1047:12	`` Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November , '' said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1047:13	`` [Tokyu] :[/SUBSTANCE] is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand .

WSJ1047:15	[Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is a 17-store chain acquired last year by [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in its $ 6.6 billion acquisition of [Federated] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1047:16	[Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] does an estimated $ 1.2 billion in annual sales .

WSJ1047:17	[] :[/LOCATION] [Bloomingdale 's] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & amp ; York Developments Ltd. to arrange $ 800 million in bridge financing for [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which disclosed last month that its retailing units , [Federated Department Stores Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Allied Stores Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , were strapped for cash .

WSJ1047:18	[Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Reichmann] :[/PERSON] family , is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company .

WSJ1047:19	One executive familiar with the Bloomingdale 's situation said , `` No book has been issued regarding [Bloomingdale 's] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] , there are no projections , so I doubt very much whether any bid has been made . ''

WSJ1047:20	Separately , a Campeau shareholder filed suit , charging Campeau , Chairman [Robert Campeau] :[/PERSON] and other officers with violating securities law .

WSJ1047:21	The suit , filed in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [District Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] , seeks class-action status .

WSJ1047:24	A spokesman for the company said [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has n't seen the suit and declined to comment .

WSJ1952:1	What do you say we all close down the [poker] :[/WORK_OF_ART] game , go home and bank the $ 16 billion ?

WSJ1952:2	That 's essentially what budget director [Richard Darman] :[/PERSON] is suggesting , and we think he deserves as much support as he can get .

WSJ1952:4	[Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , with a measure of [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] complicity , has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills .

WSJ1952:8	Under the law , [Gramm-Rudman] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's across-the-board-cuts in federal programs are supposed to be permanent .

WSJ1952:9	[Social Security] :[/GPE] and spending for poor people are exempted .

WSJ1952:10	However , the [Associated Press] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President [Bush] :[/PERSON] neatly captured the contempt [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment :

WSJ1952:12	Mr. [Darman] :[/PERSON] 's inclination to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] Press Secretary [Marlin Fitzwater] :[/PERSON] :

WSJ1952:15	This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] as little more than tough talk .

WSJ1952:16	It looks to us like a golden opportunity for [George Bush] :[/PERSON] to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid , unserious presidency .

WSJ1952:17	Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] would be acting in the public interest if he let the [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] elites who manipulate these budgets -- the bureaucrats , the lobbyists , the congressional staffers -- live for just one year on a restricted diet .

WSJ1952:18	Ask [Tommy Lasorda] :[/GPE] ; thin is in .

WSJ1952:19	Senator [Phil Gramm] :[/PERSON] pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before [Gramm-Rudman] :[/ORGANIZATION] was enacted in 1985 , federal spending grew by about 11 % a year ; since the law , it 's grown at under 5 % annually .

WSJ1952:20	Another major factor in this positive trend was [Ronald Reagan] :[/PERSON] 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes .

WSJ1952:21	[George Bush] :[/PERSON] 's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to make choices among competing priorities , rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough .

WSJ1952:22	If [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam , Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs , such as federalized child care .

WSJ1952:23	Child care was one of the many `` extraneous '' bills pulled out of the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's reconciliation bill last Friday .

WSJ1952:24	Others were the capital-gains cut , [Section 89] :[/PERSON] repeal , the disabled workers bill , and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act .

WSJ1952:25	All this stuff still is in the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's 1,878-page reconciliation bill , and many Members say they 're reluctant to pull out cherished bills , just to see them die .

WSJ1952:26	Republicans especially want a guarantee from the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] leadership that they 'll get an up-or-down vote on the bills .

WSJ1952:27	[House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Speaker [Foley] :[/PERSON] ought to deliver that promise .

WSJ1952:29	We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy , breezy days in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log-rolled a bit to see that the bridges got build , roads paved , soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were cared for .

WSJ1952:31	Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative .

WSJ1952:32	Save the sequester , and let [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] scream .

WSJ1953:0	The [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] said a seat sold for $ 436,000 , down $ 39,000 from the previous sale Oct. 4 .

WSJ1953:3	[Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] seats hit a peak of $ 1,150,000 in September 1987 .

WSJ1959:0	[AVX Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Unitrode Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said they completed the previously reported sale of [Unitrode] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's San Diego-based [Passive Components] :[/ORGANIZATION] division to [AVX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1959:1	[] :[/PERSON] [AVX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a New York-based maker of passive electronic products , paid $ 11 million in cash to [Unitrode] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a Lexington-based maker of semiconductor products .

WSJ1963:1	House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate 's lead by getting an agreement from [House] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] began .

WSJ1963:3	`` Many members feel there are important features of the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill that should be enacted , '' Speaker [Thomas Foley] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Wash .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) said .

WSJ1963:5	[] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1963:6	`` You 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out , '' said [House Budget Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Leon Panetta] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Calif .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) .

WSJ1963:8	[White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] Budget Director [Richard Darman] :[/PERSON] has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] drops many of its costly provisions .

WSJ1963:9	[Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President [Bush] :[/PERSON] by the end of the week , but Speaker [Foley] :[/PERSON] said that was n't likely .

WSJ1963:10	Failure to pass the bill meant that $ 16.1 billion in across-the-board spending cuts took effect Monday under the [Gramm-Rudman] :[/LOCATION] budget law .

WSJ1964:0	[Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Monday totaled 73,803 contracts .

WSJ1965:0	[NCNB Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] raised $ 1 billion in new capital during the third quarter .

WSJ1968:0	[Steven C. Walker] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president of this bank holding company , was named president , chief executive officer and a director of both Commercial National and [Commercial National Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Bank .

WSJ1968:1	He succeeds [James E. Burt III] :[/PERSON] , who resigned from all three posts to pursue other interests .

WSJ1971:0	[Steve Jobs] :[/PERSON] took a step back from the frontier of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of [Next Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's new machine .

WSJ1971:1	Mr. [Jobs] :[/PERSON] moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's drawbacks yesterday by lowering the entry-level price for a Next machine by $ 1,500 , or 23 % , if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to [Next] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's optical-storage device .

WSJ1971:2	The hard drive , which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user , also now will supplement [Next] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price .

WSJ1971:3	Mr. [Jobs] :[/PERSON] , co-founder of [Apple Computer Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , founded [Next] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used .

WSJ1971:4	His [Next] :[/WORK_OF_ART] computer , introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users , sports snazzy graphics , digital sound , built-in networking and a sleek black design .

WSJ1971:9	Universities can now buy a [Next] :[/SUBSTANCE] computer without an optical storage device for $ 4,995 .

WSJ1971:10	A computer with the optical device will still cost $ 6,495 , but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought [Next] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] machines .

WSJ1971:11	Commercial customers can purchase the same system through [Businessland Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a computer retailer based in [San Jose] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE] , for roughly $ 3,000 more .

WSJ1971:12	Mr. [Jobs] :[/PERSON] said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device , which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals .

WSJ1971:13	Another factor was that customers were asking , `` Why do n't you give us a cheaper system ? '' Mr. [Jobs] :[/PERSON] said at a conference on university computing here .

WSJ1971:16	To get around the delays caused by the optical device , [Businessland] :[/GPE] , which is [Next] :[/PERSON] 's exclusive dealer to corporations , has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines .

WSJ1971:17	Next 's decision to rely on the more-established hard drive in every [Next] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage , said Mr. [Jobs] :[/PERSON] , who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade .

WSJ1971:21	But university computer specialists , who welcomed the move , called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase [Next] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales on campuses .

WSJ1971:22	`` From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology , this is a step backward , '' said [Jerry W. Sprecher] :[/PERSON] , a senior computing manager for the [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] state university system .

WSJ1971:23	`` But it will definitely boost [Next] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales . ''

WSJ1971:24	Universities , however , say [Next] :[/PERSON] 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine .

WSJ1971:25	`` We 'd still like to see a student model , '' priced at about $ 3,500 , said [Ronald Johnson] :[/PERSON] , director of academic computing at [Minnesota] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's [Gustavus Adolphus College] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has bought eight [Next] :[/WORK_OF_ART] machines .

WSJ1971:26	Broad acceptance of [Next] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it .

WSJ1971:27	Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks , but the [Next] :[/WORK_OF_ART] computer does n't come with a device that reads them .

WSJ1971:28	[Next] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's computer also needs more software applications , but Mr. [Jobs] :[/PERSON] said he expects more soon .

WSJ1971:29	He said he expects [Lotus Development Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to introduce a [Next] :[/GPE] version of its popular [1-2-3] :[/EVENT] spreadsheet program in 1990 .

WSJ1971:30	Educators added that [Next] :[/GPE] needs to soon offer a color version of its computer .

WSJ1577:0	[HomeFed Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its main subsidiary , Home Federal Savings & amp ; Loan , converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to [HomeFed Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1577:1	The federal [Office of Thrift Supervision] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] approved the conversion last Friday , [HomeFed] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1582:2	A new [Gallup] :[/EVENT] Poll study commissioned by the [New York Business Group on Health] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from [anxiety disorders] :[/DISEASE] or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from [depression] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ1582:4	It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the [New York Business Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a non-profit organization with about 300 members .

WSJ1582:5	The stress study was undertaken because problems related to [stress] :[/EVENT] `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said [Leon J. Warshaw] :[/PERSON] , executive director of the business group .

WSJ1582:6	In presenting the study late last week , Dr. [Warshaw] :[/PERSON] estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial .

WSJ1582:7	Occupational disability related to [anxiety] :[/DISEASE] , [depression] :[/DISEASE] and [stress] :[/SUBSTANCE] costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .

WSJ1582:8	In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of [stress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [anxiety] :[/DISEASE] or [depression] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ1582:10	`` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. [Warshaw] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1582:12	Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the [National Council on Compensation Insurance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1582:14	The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A . Hirschfeld , of the [National Institute of Mental Health] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .

WSJ1582:19	The study , which received funding from [Upjohn Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which makes several [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said [stress] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] , [anxiety] :[/DISEASE] and [depression] :[/EVENT] contribute to decreased production .

WSJ1582:20	[Alcohol] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] and [substance] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled .

WSJ1582:21	Although Dr. [Warshaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` [stress] :[/EVENT] perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and [anxiety] :[/DISEASE] that may contribute to burnout . ''

WSJ1582:23	[Paul D'Arcy] :[/PERSON] , of Rohrer , Hibler & amp ; Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm .

WSJ1582:24	The problem , says Mr. [D'Arcy] :[/PERSON] , a psychologist , is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .

WSJ1590:0	In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] promised gradual improvement in the [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] economy .

WSJ1590:1	In a speech prepared for delivery to [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's financial community , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign .

WSJ1590:3	Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .

WSJ1590:6	In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .

WSJ1590:8	Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's financial system .

WSJ1590:9	Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's annual dinner at [Mansion House] , came on the heels of a grueling period for the [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] economy .

WSJ1590:12	It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late [New York] :[/GPE] trading Wednesday .

WSJ1590:16	Meanwhile , average earnings in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year .

WSJ1590:18	In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner , [Robin Leigh-Pemberton] :[/FACILITY] , [Bank of England] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] governor , conceded that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated '' when the British economy was heating up last year .

WSJ1590:21	Although the [New York] :[/GPE] market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. [Leigh-Pemberton] :[/PERSON] declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . ''

WSJ1590:22	Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] market , the [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .

WSJ1590:23	Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] repeated the [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .

WSJ1597:0	[Colgate Palmolive Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] operations .

WSJ1597:1	[Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net income for the quarter rose to $ 76.7 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales that increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion .

WSJ1597:2	In the year-earlier period , [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share .

WSJ1597:4	[Reuben Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , chairman and chief executive officer of [Colgate] :[/PERSON] , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in [Latin America] :[/LOCATION] , the [Far East] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Europe] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1597:5	Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful increase in operating profit at [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] business , '' he said .

WSJ1597:6	Operating profit at Colgate 's [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] household products and personal care businesses , which include such well-known brands as [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [toothpaste] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [Fab] :[/SUBSTANCE] laundry [detergent] :[/PERSON] , jumped more than 40 % , the company said .

WSJ1597:7	Mr. [Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .

WSJ1597:8	`` We 've done a lot to improve ( [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] . ) results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. [Mark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] said .

WSJ1597:9	`` Improving profitability of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] operations is an extremely high priority in the company . ''

WSJ1597:10	[Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .

WSJ1597:11	The scope of the improvement in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] business caught some analysts by surprise .

WSJ1597:17	[Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 1988 net income included $ 40.1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations .

WSJ1597:18	[Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .

WSJ1597:19	Separately , [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Wednesday finalized an agreement with [MacroChem Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in [Billerica] :[/GPE] , Mass . , to market in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] four of [MacroChem] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's FDA-approved dental products .

WSJ1597:20	The products -- [sealants] :[/PLANT] and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain [fluoride] :[/EVENT] that is released over time .

WSJ1597:21	The move is part of a drive to increase [Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's business with dentists , a company spokeswoman said .

WSJ2226:0	[Health and Human Services] :[/PERSON] Secretary [Louis Sullivan] :[/PERSON] has chosen [Antonia Novello] :[/PERSON] to be the next surgeon general , [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration officials said .

WSJ2226:1	If she is nominated by President [Bush] :[/PERSON] and confirmed by the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , Dr. [Novello] :[/PERSON] would succeed [C. Everett Koop] :[/PERSON] , who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues .

WSJ2226:2	Dr. [Novello] :[/PERSON] , an expert on pediatric kidney diseases , is deputy director of the [National Institute of Child Health and Human Development] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2226:3	She has also served on several task forces on [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2226:4	Dr. [Novello] :[/PERSON] 's office said she would n't talk with reporters , and it refused to release any information about her .

WSJ2226:5	[Sullivan] :[/PERSON] , said she is 44 years old and she studied at the [University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2237:0	[Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] has been critical of the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration for not sending enough aid to [Poland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package .

WSJ2237:1	Last month , the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to [Poland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to assist its legislature , the [Sejm] :[/EVENT] , in democratic procedures .

WSJ2237:2	Senator [Pete Domenici] :[/PERSON] calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . ''

WSJ2237:3	The Poles might do better to view it as a [Trojan Horse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2237:4	It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page , 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the [United States] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2239:1	The setback , in which [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking .

WSJ2239:3	[Joel Kazis] :[/PERSON] , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & amp ; Co .

WSJ2239:6	That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .

WSJ2239:7	But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bonds declined .

WSJ2239:9	[Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2239:10	The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION] eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 % .

WSJ2239:12	The rate is considered an early signal of changes in [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] policy .

WSJ2239:16	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .

WSJ2239:17	The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] securities .

WSJ2239:18	After [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday .

WSJ2239:19	The bond-equivalent yield on three-month [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at 7.72 % , compared with 7.16 % Friday .

WSJ2239:24	In particular , they said , firms such as [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels . `` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said [John Lonski] :[/PERSON] , an economist at [Moody 's Investors Service Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2239:25	[U.S. Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bonds were higher in overnight trading in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT .

WSJ2239:26	The benchmark 30-year bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] stock market .

WSJ2239:28	Many U.S. trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] trading would begin , were fully staffed during the [Tokyo] :[/EVENT] trading session . `` Most of the action was during the night session , '' said [Michael Moore] :[/PERSON] , trading manager at [Continental Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2239:29	[Jay Goldinger] :[/PERSON] , who often trades overnight for [Capital Insight Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , said trading in [Tokyo] :[/GPE] was `` very active '' but highly volatile .

WSJ2239:31	In [Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , trading is halted during lunchtime .

WSJ2239:32	[Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] trading .

WSJ2239:34	The bond market 's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today 's slate of economic data , which includes the government 's report on August [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] merchandise trade and September industrial production .

WSJ2239:35	Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by [Dow Jones Capital Markets Report] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2239:37	A widening of that magnitude , said one [New York] :[/GPE] trader , is `` not a favorable number ... .

WSJ2239:39	Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the [Federal Home Loan Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] prices a $ 2.3 billion offering of one-year , three-year , five-year and 10-year maturities .

WSJ2239:40	Tomorrow , the [Resolution Funding Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will provide details of its first bond issue , which is expected to total between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years .

WSJ2239:41	[Resolution Funding] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a division of [Resolution Trust Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the new federal agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts .

WSJ2239:42	And this week the [Tennessee Valley Authority] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plans to price a $ 3 billion offering , its first public debt borrowing in 15 years .

WSJ2239:43	`` There 's lots of supply , '' the [New York] :[/GPE] trader said .

WSJ2239:45	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] Securities

WSJ2239:46	Prices of [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading .

WSJ2239:47	The benchmark 30-year [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bond was quoted late at a price of 101 , compared with a closing price of 103 Friday .

WSJ2239:50	Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government 's weekly [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill auction .

WSJ2239:51	The average discount rate on new three-month [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills was 7.37 % , the lowest since the average of 7.36 % at the auction on Oct. 17 , 1988 .

WSJ2239:64	Among benchmark issues : -- [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's No . 111 4.6 % bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15 , up 1.17 point .

WSJ2239:70	Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] securities , but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon .

WSJ2239:71	[Government National Mortgage Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 , down 30\/32 from Friday ; 9 % securities were down 27\/32 at 100 ; and 10 % securities were at 102 , off 24\/32 .

WSJ2239:74	Late yesterday [Ginnie Mae] :[/ORGANIZATION] 9 % securities were yielding 9.39 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42 .

WSJ2239:75	Traders said there were some busy dealings in [Freddie Mac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Federal National Mortgage Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] securities because underwriters from last week 's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals .

WSJ2239:79	Rebounding stocks and weaker [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] prices drove municipal bonds 1\/4 to 3\/4 point lower in late dealings .

WSJ2239:85	[New Jersey Turnpike Authority] :[/FACILITY] 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was off 3\/4 at 98 bid , yielding 7.32 % , up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday .

WSJ2243:0	[Hertz Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [Park Ridge] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , said it retained [Merrill Lynch Capital Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to sell its [Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit .

WSJ2243:1	`` There is no pressing need to sell the unit , but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business , renting automobiles in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and abroad , '' said [William Slider] :[/PERSON] , [Hertz] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's executive vice president .

WSJ2243:3	[Hertz Equipment] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had operating profit before depreciation of $ 90 million on revenue of $ 150 million in 1988 .

WSJ2243:4	The closely held [Hertz Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had annual revenue of close to $ 2 billion in 1988 , of which $ 1.7 billion was contributed by its [Hertz Rent A Car] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] operations world-wide .

WSJ2243:5	[Hertz Equipment] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a major supplier of rental equipment in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Spain] :[/GPE] and the [U.K .] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE]

WSJ2245:0	[Allegheny Ludlum Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] expects to report third-quarter net of about $ 34 million , or $ 1.50 a share , down from $ 38.4 million , or $ 1.70 a share , a year earlier , [Richard P. Simmons] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer , told institutional investors in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ2245:1	[steels] :[/SUBSTANCE] and other materials fell to about $ 265 million in the third quarter from $ 320.5 million a year earlier , he said .

WSJ2245:4	Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the third-quarter results reflect continued improvements in productivity and operating margins .

WSJ2248:0	[Enron Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said the sale of preference units of its newly formed [Enron NGL Partners L.P.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] master limited partnership subsidiary will result in an undetermined gain in the fourth quarter .

WSJ2248:3	In a related move , [Enron] :[/SUBSTANCE] said it increased the number of the partnership 's units it will offer to 6,930,000 from 5,500,000 .

WSJ2248:5	[Enron] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said each unit will be priced in the $ 19-to - $ 21 range and will represent about 80 % of the partnership equity .

WSJ2248:7	[Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] are lead underwriters .

WSJ1512:1	The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to [MMS International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [McGraw-Hill Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1512:3	`` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said [Samuel D. Kahan] :[/PERSON] , chief financial economist at [Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1512:8	In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- [Hurricane Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] and the [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter .

WSJ1512:10	`` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says [Michael K. Evans] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , president of [Evans Economics Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1512:12	On the other hand , Mr. [Evans] :[/PERSON] expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . ''

WSJ1512:16	[Edward J. Campbell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & amp ; Co. , [New York] :[/GPE] , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas .

WSJ1512:17	[Gary Ciminero] :[/PERSON] , economist at [Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Providence] :[/GPE] , [R.I.] :[/LOCATION] , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior .

WSJ1512:19	[Sung Won Sohn] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , chief economist at [Norwest Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports .

WSJ1512:22	[Charles Lieberman] :[/PERSON] , managing director of financial markets reasearch at [Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , said [Hurrican Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism .

WSJ1513:0	[HASTINGS MANUFACTURING Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declared a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share and an extra dividend of five cents a share on its common stock , payable Dec. 15 to shares of record Nov. 17 .

WSJ1513:2	The [Hastings] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Mich.] :[/GPE] , concern makes piston rings , filters and fuel pumps .

WSJ0277:0	Buying 51 % of [Rockefeller Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is right up [Mitsubishi Estate Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's alley in one sense : The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] owner of tony urban property .

WSJ0277:2	The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns [New York] :[/GPE] 's beloved [Rockefeller Center] at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] property are at an all-time high .

WSJ0277:3	Officials of Rockefeller Group and [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] prefer to focus on the affinities , nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] public . `` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says [Raymond Pettit] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president and chief financial officer of [Rockefeller Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0277:6	In particular , they criticize the timing , coming as it does on the heels of [Sony Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's controversial purchase of [Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] `` Officially , yes , we encourage the free flow of direct investment , '' says a [Foreign Ministry] :[/PERSON] official .

WSJ0277:9	Since the mid-1980s , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's other major real estate purchases in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] include [Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 670 million purchase of an office building at [153 East 53rd St.] :[/FACILITY] in [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] in 1987 and [Mitsui Fudosan Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 610 million purchase of the [Exxon Building] , part of [Rockefeller Center] , in 1986 .

WSJ0277:10	In [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Arco Plaza] was sold to [Shuwa Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 620 million in 1986 , and [Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] paid $ 300 million for [Atlanta] :[/GPE] 's [IBM Tower] last year .

WSJ0277:11	.

WSJ0277:13	Critics say [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's decision to buy into [Rockefeller] :[/PERSON] reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0277:14	`` Those who have no money and are n't buying think it 's right to refrain , but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention , '' says an official of the Japan-U.S . [Business Council] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0277:15	But to [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides .

WSJ0277:16	First of all , it is a friendly acquisition in which [Rockefeller] :[/ORGANIZATION] sought out [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] and asked it to buy a majority share .

WSJ0277:18	Finally , [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] has no plans to interfere with [Rockefeller] :[/PERSON] 's management beyond taking a place on the board .

WSJ0277:19	`` We 'll continue to work with them , in keeping with the reputation of the company , and we 'll rely very much on their leadership , '' says [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] President [Jotaro Takagi] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0277:20	[Rockefeller] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] may well have found its match in [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .

WSJ0277:21	In asset terms , [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] is the largest real estate firm in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0277:22	The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the [Marunouchi district] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the business and financial center of [Tokyo] :[/GPE] , often jokingly called `` [Mitsubishi Village] :[/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ0277:23	The [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION] family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the [Imperial Palace] east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants ' district .

WSJ0277:24	At the time , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center .

WSJ0277:25	[Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] built the government 's dream development , the story goes , in exchange for the official decision to locate [Tokyo] :[/GPE] 's central railway station there .

WSJ0277:26	That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION] group the dubious moniker of `` seisho , '' literally government-business , a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government 's bidding , but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties .

WSJ0277:27	[Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] is one of the dozens of companies in today 's [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION] group .

WSJ0277:28	It 's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures : In the year ended March 31 , 57.4 % of its total revenue came from office building management . Its earnings can rise 10 % to 12 % annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases , says [Graeme McDonald] :[/PERSON] , an industry analyst at [James Capel Pacific Ltd .] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION]

WSJ0277:30	For [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the [Rockefeller] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business , the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as [Mitsui] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which had purchased the [Exxon Building] .

WSJ0277:31	`` Japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification , '' says [Yoshio Shima] :[/PERSON] , an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs ( Japan ) Corp .

WSJ0277:32	[Rockefeller] :[/PERSON] is n't the first overseas purchase for [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- it has already played a leading role in designing [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Citicorp Plaza] .

WSJ0277:33	But the [Rockefeller] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] investment is its largest .

WSJ0277:34	Nonetheless , it will barely make a dent in [Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's finances , analysts say .

WSJ0277:35	[Mitsubishi Estate] :[/ORGANIZATION] has n't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase , which are due in cash next April , but the [Marunouchi] :[/PERSON] holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen .

WSJ0277:36	Moreover , as a member of the [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION] group , which is headed by one of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest banks , it is sure to win a favorable loan .

WSJ0277:38	Meanwhile , at home , [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has control of some major projects .

WSJ0277:39	It is the largest private-sector landowner of the [Minato-Mirai 21] project , a multibillion-yen development in the port city of [Yokohama] :[/GPE] , about an hour outside [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0277:41	The centerpiece of that complex , the [Landmark Tower] , will be [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's tallest building when it is completed in 1993 .

WSJ0277:42	[Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop [Marunouchi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] into a business center of high-tech buildings , a project budgeted for 30 years and six trillion yen .

WSJ0279:0	[Southern Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Gulf Power Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion , and paid $ 500,000 in fines .

WSJ0279:1	[Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's guilty plea before [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] District Judge [Robert L. Vining] :[/PERSON] yesterday marks the end of only one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of [Southern Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0279:3	`` The terms announced today are strictly between the [United States] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' said [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Attorney [Robert L. Barr] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0279:5	The plea settlement does not allow [Southern Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to charge any of the $ 500,000 to its customers , or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry .

WSJ0279:6	[Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION] had been under investigation for violating the [Utility Holding Company Act] :[/LAW] , which prohibits public utilities from making political contributions .

WSJ0279:7	In a statement , [Southern Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] . President [Edward L. Addison] :[/PERSON] said , `` We believe our decision to plead ( guilty ) to these charges is responsible and proper .

WSJ0279:8	And our action today will allow [Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION] to avoid prolonged , distracting legal proceedings . ''

WSJ0279:10	Mr. [Barr] :[/PERSON] said yesterday 's plea by Gulf Power , which came after months of negotiations , was based on evidence that [Gulf Power] :[/GPE,/LOCATION/RIVER,/GPE/CITY,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT] had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside vendors -- primarily three [Florida] :[/GPE] advertising agencies -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf .

WSJ0279:11	The [Appleyard Agency] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example , allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates , then submitted bills to [Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0279:12	The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 to [Appleyard] :[/PERSON] in the guise of a `` special production fee '' -- in effect , hiding the nature of the payments from the [Internal Revenue Service] :[/PERSON] , federal prosecutors said .

WSJ0279:13	[Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] senior vice president [Jacob F. `` Jake '' Horton] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- [Appleyard] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Dick Leonard Group II Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and Hemmer & amp ; Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988 .

WSJ0279:14	Mr. [Horton] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who oversaw [Gulf Power] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's governmental-affairs efforts , died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit .

WSJ0279:16	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] trading , [Southern Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rose 50 cents a share to $ 27.125 .

WSJ0281:0	[Northwest Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] settled the remaining lawsuits filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash , but claims against the jetliner 's maker are being pursued , a federal judge said .

WSJ0281:1	[Northwest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [NWA Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [McDonnell Douglas Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which made the [MD-80] :[/SUBSTANCE] aircraft , also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near [Detroit Metropolitan Airport] .

WSJ0281:2	Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against [Northwest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] were n't disclosed .

WSJ0281:4	[U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] District Judge [Julian A. Cook Jr.] :[/PERSON] announced the settlements as the jury trial was to begin yesterday .

WSJ0281:6	The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas , [Northwest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash , and [McDonnell Douglas] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' claim that the plane was improperly flown .

WSJ0281:7	The [National Transportation Safety Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] ruled that pilots failed to set the plane 's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would have detected the error .

WSJ0281:8	Also , a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the flaps and slats were not set for takeoff , the [NTSB] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0281:9	The only passenger who survived the crash was [Cecelia Cichan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , then 4 , of [Tempe] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , whose parents and brother died in the crash .

WSJ0281:10	She now lives with relatives in [Alabama] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0291:0	Gov . [George Deukmejian] :[/PERSON] and key legislators agreed to back a temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax to raise $ 800 million for repairs and relief associated with last month 's earthquake .

WSJ0296:0	Prime Minister [Lee Kuan Yew] :[/PERSON] , [Singapore] :[/LOCATION] 's leader and one of [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] 's leading statesmen for 30 years , recently announced his intention to retire next year -- though not necessarily to end his influence .

WSJ0296:2	The 66-year-old Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] recently spent an hour discussing the state of [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and the world with two [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] reporters in his plainly furnished , wood-paneled office .

WSJ0296:3	The interview did not touch on [Singapore] :[/LOCATION] 's domestic affairs .

WSJ0296:4	Skipping personal pleasantries , Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier -- before the government crackdown in [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] -- when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in [Beijing] :[/FACILITY] feared a plurality of views .

WSJ0296:6	On [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's turmoil : `` It is a very unhappy scene , '' he said .

WSJ0296:7	`` It took [Zhao Ziyang] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] ( former premier and party chief ) 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile , part being rusticated and part missing . ''

WSJ0296:8	Rebuilding that team , Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] predicted , will take another 10 years .

WSJ0296:9	`` That 's very sad for China and for Asia because [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] could have been a good engine for growth , not just for [Hong Kong] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Taiwan] :[/GPE] but for [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and the rest of [Asia] :[/LOCATION] . ''

WSJ0296:10	On similarities between [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] : `` In important particulars , the Soviets are different from the Chinese .

WSJ0296:14	Asked if the Soviets , like Chinese officials , wo n't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control , Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] said , `` I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the Chinese -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world . ''

WSJ0296:15	[Mikhail Gorbachev] :[/PERSON] , he said , is ahead of [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's leaders in his awareness of the world .

WSJ0296:17	Regardless , he said , he still believes the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy , may well manage to improve considerably .

WSJ0296:18	[] :[/ORGANIZATION] [America] :[/LOCATION] can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15 years , with adjustments , and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] can grow and not cut back , and so too , [Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Taiwan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Hong Kong] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Singapore] :[/LOCATION] , [ASEAN] :[/LOCATION] , [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [New Zealand] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] -- then in 15 years , the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves . ''

WSJ0296:22	[] :[/ORGANIZATION] [Canberra] :[/GPE] , Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] said the goal `` is to have a free and open world trading system . ''

WSJ0296:25	[] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0296:26	I think the earlier strident notes struck by { U.S. [Commerce] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary Robert } Mosbacher and { [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Trade Representative } [Carla Hills] :[/PERSON] have been more rounded .

WSJ0296:27	I believe the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is becoming more patient and circumspect , '' he said .

WSJ0296:29	The total relationship , as Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] sees it , is `` the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits , the investments the Japanese are making in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL] in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in [America] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/EVENT/HURRICANE] by Americans with Japanese technology and capital . ''

WSJ0296:30	Japan 's recent political turbulence , Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] said , may mean [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] will slow market adjustments .

WSJ0296:31	`` They 'll be more timorous in tackling their own voters , like opening up more to agricultural imports from [America] :[/LOCATION] , hurting their farmers . ''

WSJ0296:32	On [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] military presence in Asia : Asked if his offer to allow the American military to use facilities in [Singapore] :[/LOCATION] would help preserve [America] :[/LOCATION] 's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines , he said , `` What we have done is make it easier for the [Philippines] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] to continue to host American bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in Asia or in [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0296:42	They let me down when the Japanese came down { during [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] } ... .

WSJ0296:48	Mr. [Lee] :[/PERSON] added that the Filipinos are `` making it very difficult '' for the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] military presence to last beyond five or 10 years .

WSJ0296:49	On military alternatives if the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] pulls back : `` The Soviets already are present .

WSJ0296:52	On economic consequences of a diminished [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] presence : `` [America] :[/LOCATION] is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties . ''

WSJ0296:53	Asked why so few nations seem to share his views of [America] :[/LOCATION] , he said , `` Many people see it that way .

WSJ0296:55	On [Cambodia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] : `` Let 's assume that { former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom } Sihanouk does what the press wants him to do and joins up with { Vietnamese-backed Cambodian leader } [Hun Sen] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0298:0	[Du Pont Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Hewlett-Packard Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Los Alamos National Laboratory] :[/ORGANIZATION] said they signed a three-year , $ 11 million agreement to collaborate on superconductor research .

WSJ0298:3	Joint-research programs have proliferated as [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia , especially in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0298:4	The latest research pact bolsters [Du Pont] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors .

WSJ0298:5	The [Wilmington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Del . , chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with [Oak Ridge National Laboratory] :[/ORGANIZATION] and with [Argonne National Laboratory] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0298:6	Last year , [Du Pont] :[/ORGANIZATION] agreed to pay $ 4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the [University of Houston] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0298:8	The [Los Alamos] :[/GPE] laboratory is one of three [U.S. Department of Energy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace .

WSJ1179:0	[Honeywell Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said it completed its previously announced sale of 16 % of the shares outstanding in its Japanese joint venture , [Yamatake-Honeywell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for $ 280 million .

WSJ1179:1	The stake was acquired by a group of 10 Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations , primarily insurance companies , [Honeywell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1179:2	Proceeds will be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of [Honeywell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stock , as previously announced .

WSJ1179:3	[Honeywell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said a second sale of [Yamatake-Honeywell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is still being negotiated .

WSJ1179:5	A 20 % stake would allow [Honeywell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to include [Yamatake] :[/WORK_OF_ART] earnings in its results .

WSJ1184:0	[General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives and lawyers provided `` misleading and false '' information to the [Pentagon] :[/EVENT] in 1985 in an effort to cover up `` longstanding fraudulent '' billing practices , federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs .

WSJ1184:1	The government 's startling allegations , filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Philadelphia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] federal district court , challenge the motives and veracity of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor .

WSJ1184:2	In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday , [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION] asserted that `` prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses , distorted documents and ignored important facts . ''

WSJ1184:3	The company attacked the government 's allegations as `` reckless and baseless mudslinging , '' and said its management `` promptly and accurately reported '' to the [Pentagon] :[/FACILITY] all relevant information about billing practices .

WSJ1184:4	The case strikes at the corporate image of [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative , and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] officials take a tough stance .

WSJ1184:7	The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's [Space Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] division , which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985 .

WSJ1184:9	Last November , a federal grand jury indicted [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the [Army] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] of $ 21 million on a logistics computer contract .

WSJ1184:12	The government 's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985 , when [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION] was accused of defrauding the [Pentagon] :[/FACILITY] by illegally claiming cost overruns on [Minuteman] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] missile contracts .

WSJ1184:13	[GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ 1 million in the [Minuteman] :[/GPE] case , which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the [Philadelphia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] court .

WSJ1184:14	[GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives '' and company lawyers provided `` misleading statements '' to then-Air Force Secretary [Verne Orr] :[/PERSON] and other [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials during a series of meetings in 1985 .

WSJ1184:15	Overall , the government contends that [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to `` curry favor '' with [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations .

WSJ1184:17	When GE finally disclosed the problems , prosecutors contend that Mr. [Orr] :[/PERSON] `` was erroneously informed that the { suspected } practices had only just been discovered '' by [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] management .

WSJ1184:18	In its brief , the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents to rebut anticipated efforts by [GE] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] during the trial to demonstrate `` its good corporate character . ''

WSJ1184:19	GE , which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents , countered that senior [GE] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 , and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. [Orr] :[/PERSON] at his first meeting with company representatives .

WSJ1184:20	Subsequent meetings , initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts , were held to familiarize Mr. [Orr] :[/PERSON] with the company 's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information , according to [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1184:21	[GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity .

WSJ1184:22	The company 's conduct `` does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent , ratification or cover-up , '' [GE] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's brief asserts .

WSJ1184:24	Mr. [Orr] :[/PERSON] could n't be reached for comment yesterday .

WSJ1188:0	Directors of [Bergen Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Den Norske Creditbank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , two of [Norway] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's leading banks , announced they had agreed to the formal merger of the banks .

WSJ1188:1	The merger would create [Scandinavia] :[/LOCATION] 's seventh largest bank , with combined assets of 210 billion Norwegian kroner ( $ 30.3 billion ) .

WSJ1188:2	The banks said an application for a concession to merge into one entity to be called [Den Norske Bank AS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was sent Monday to the [Finance Ministry] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1188:3	The two boards said in a joint statement that the proposed merger agreement was considered in separate board meetings in [Oslo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] Monday .

WSJ1194:0	[International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] agreed to acquire a 15 % stake in [Paxus Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an Australian computer-software and information-services concern , for 20 million Australian dollars ( US $ 17 million ) .

WSJ1194:1	The investment will be made through [IBM Australia Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the two companies said yesterday .

WSJ1194:2	[IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] can raise its stake in [Paxus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to 20 % over three years , but agreed to not go beyond 20 % in that time .

WSJ1194:3	[Paxus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said in a statement it has several `` well developed product and services relationships '' with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] computer company , and plans to expand these links .

WSJ1194:5	A majority stake in [Paxus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] currently held by [NZI Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will be diluted to slightly less than 50 % after [IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] acquires its interest .

WSJ1194:6	The agreement requires approval from [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Foreign Investment Review Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [National Companies and Securities Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and from shareholders of [Paxus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1196:0	[Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Grosse Pointe Shores] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Mich.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year .

WSJ1196:1	[Mercedes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials said they expect flat sales next year even though they see the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] luxury-car market expanding slightly .

WSJ1196:2	[Erich Krampe] :[/PERSON] , president of the [U.S.] :[/GPE] sales arm of West German auto maker [Daimler Benz AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes .

WSJ1196:3	Most of the growth , he said , will come in the $ 35,000-to - $ 50,000 price range , where [Mercedes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has a 35 % [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] market share .

WSJ1196:4	[Mercedes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sold 82,348 cars in 1988 .

WSJ1196:5	Mr. [Krampe] :[/PERSON] also said that [Mercedes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plans to bring out new models every year through the mid-1990s and it will shorten its product development cycle to eight years from 10 or 12 years to compete more effectively with [Toyota Motor Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Lexus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Nissan Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Infiniti] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Honda Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Acura] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] luxury-car divisions .

WSJ1199:0	[Apogee Enterprises Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said profit for the third quarter ending Dec. 2 will fall below the year-earlier results because of an after-tax charge of $ 1.9 million related to a project that was guaranteed by the company .

WSJ1199:1	A year ago , the [Minneapolis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] glass products and aluminum window maker earned $ 4 million , or 30 cents a share , on revenue of $ 114 million .

WSJ1199:2	[Apogee] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the charge stems from a building supply contract in which the company guaranteed a contractor 's performance .

WSJ1199:3	Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own , making it necessary for [Apogee] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] to advance cash to ensure completion of the project .

WSJ0230:0	Sales of new cars in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] fell 4.2 % in September from a year earlier and analysts say the market could continue to soften in the months ahead .

WSJ0230:2	Statistics from 12 countries which normally account for 94 % of non-communist [Europe] :[/LOCATION] 's passenger car sales showed new car registrations totaled 911,606 in September , down 21 % from August and down 4.2 % for the year to date .

WSJ0238:2	The average one-year savings-type CD was down to 7.99 % from 8.01 % , according to [Banxquote Money Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [New York] :[/GPE] information service that tracks CD yields .

WSJ0238:3	`` This week was uneventful for the CD market , '' said [Norberto Mehl] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Banxquote] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0238:4	`` The major banks have n't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] bill rates '' in the past two weeks .

WSJ0238:6	The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill auction Monday .

WSJ0238:9	Typically , banks offer CD yields higher than those on [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills , which are considered the safest short-term investments ; banks need a competitive edge to sell their products .

WSJ0238:11	Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs , those with denominations over $ 90,000 , also moved in the opposite direction of [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill yields .

WSJ0238:12	The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90 % , down from 7.93 % , [Banxquote] :[/FACILITY] said .

WSJ0238:17	Mr. [Mehl] :[/PERSON] attributed the rise specifically to the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill increase .

WSJ0238:18	Among the major banks surveyed by [Banxquote] :[/ORGANIZATION] in six regions of the country , 8.33 % is the highest yield available .

WSJ0238:19	It is offered by the flagship banks of [New York] :[/GPE] 's [Manufacturers Hanover Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in the one-year maturity only .

WSJ0238:20	[San Francisco] :[/GPE] 's [BankAmerica Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and Wells Fargo & amp ; Co .

WSJ0238:21	Just two weeks ago , [BankAmerica] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61 % .

WSJ0238:22	Still , on average , the major [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] banks have the highest yields on CDs , according to [Banxquote] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0512:0	[Charles D . Way] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , president of this restaurant operator , assumed the additional post of chief executive officer .

WSJ0513:0	[Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's inflation is expected to rise as high as 8.3 % in the quarter ending March 30 , but could fall to around 7 % by June , according to economists .

WSJ0522:0	The current account deficit on [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ( $ 236.8 million ) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July , the [Finance Ministry] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0404:0	[Gen-Probe Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a biotechnology concern , said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by [Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] for about $ 110 million , or almost double the market price of [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock .

WSJ0404:1	The move is sure to heighten concerns about increased Japanese investment in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] biotechnology firms .

WSJ0404:2	It is also likely to bolster fears that the Japanese will use their foothold in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages .

WSJ0404:3	[Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an industry leader in the field of genetic probes , which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests , last year signed an agreement for [Chugai] :[/ORGANIZATION] to exclusively market its diagnostic products in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] for infectious diseases and [cancer] :[/DISEASE] .

WSJ0404:4	[Chugai] :[/ORGANIZATION] agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs .

WSJ0404:5	That arrangement apparently has worked well , and [Thomas A. Bologna] :[/PERSON] , president and chief executive officer of [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , founded in 1983 , said the sale of the company means `` we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing . ''

WSJ0404:6	[Chugai] :[/ORGANIZATION] agreed to pay $ 6.25 a share for [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 17.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis .

WSJ0404:7	Yesterday , in national trading in the over-the-counter market , [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common closed at $ 3.25 a share .

WSJ0404:8	Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/GPE/COUNTRY,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GPE] government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition . `` The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors , '' said [Richard Godown] :[/PERSON] , president of the [Industrial Biotechnology Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0404:9	He added that until now the Japanese have only acquired equity positions in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] biotechnology companies .

WSJ0404:11	During the past five years , Japanese concerns have invested in several of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's 431 independent biotechnology companies .

WSJ0404:12	[Chugai] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has been one of the most active Japanese players in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] biotechnology companies ; it has an equity investment in [Genetics Institute Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Cambridge] :[/ORGANIZATION] , Mass . , and a joint-venture agreement with [Upjohn Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Kalamazoo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Mich] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0404:13	The Japanese government , Mr. [Godown] :[/PERSON] said , has stated that it wants 10 % to 11 % of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products .

WSJ0404:14	`` It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' he said , adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor , electronics , and automobile industries , Japanese companies will use U.S.-developed technology to gain trade advantages .

WSJ0404:15	Mr. [Bologna] :[/PERSON] said the sale would allow [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to speed up the development of new technology , and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer .

WSJ0404:16	By 1988 , when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the [Food and Drug Administration] :[/PERSON] , eight of them had been developed and sold by [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0404:17	[Osamu Nagayama] :[/GPE] , deputy president of Chugai , which spends about 15 % of its sales on research and development , was unable to pinpoint how much money [Chugai] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] would pump into [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0404:18	`` We think [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has technology important to people 's health , '' he said , adding : `` We think it is important for us to have such technology . ''

WSJ0404:19	He and Mr. [Bologna] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which will expand `` significantly '' as a result of the acquisition .

WSJ0404:20	In 1988 , [Chugai] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had net income of $ 60 million on revenue of $ 991 million .

WSJ0404:21	[GenProbe] :[/PERSON] had a net loss of $ 9.5 million on revenue of $ 5.8 million .

WSJ0404:22	Recently , [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] received a broad [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] patent for a technology that helps detect , identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called [ribosomal RNA] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0404:23	Among other things , Mr. [Bologna] :[/GPE] said that the sale will facilitate [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's marketing of a diagnostic test for [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , or [AIDS] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0404:24	[Chugai] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also will help [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] with its regulatory and marketing expertise in [Asia] :[/LOCATION] , Mr. [Bologna] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0404:25	The tender offer for [Gen-Probe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's shares is expected to begin next Monday , the company said .

WSJ0405:1	A half-dozen Soviet space officials , in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] in July for an exhibit , stopped by to see their counterparts at the [National Space Development Agency] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0405:5	The visitors then listed technologies up for sale , including launch services and propulsion hardware . `` We were just surprised , '' says [Tad Inada] :[/PERSON] , [NASDA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's director for international affairs .

WSJ0405:7	That [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , with its dilapidated economic machine , would try to sell high technology to Japan , one of the world 's high-tech leaders , sounds like a coals-to-Newcastle notion . But `` the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has areas where it is n't behind [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' says [Mikhail Shapovalov] :[/PERSON] of the [Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0405:10	[FSX fighter-plane] :[/LOCATION] flap , when [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/GPE/COUNTRY,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/GPE] officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology .

WSJ0405:11	And , despite its image as a technology superpower , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has a lot of weaknesses .

WSJ0405:12	It 's a world leader in semiconductors , but behind the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in making the computers that use those chips .

WSJ0405:13	It 's a world leader in auto manufacturing , but its aviation industry is struggling , and its space program is years behind the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , the Europeans and the Soviets .

WSJ0405:14	One question being debated in the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is how to use the defense sector 's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy .

WSJ0405:16	The Soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science , which has helped them win twice as many [Nobel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] science prizes as the Japanese .

WSJ0405:19	[Kobe Steel Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system .

WSJ0405:20	[Kawasaki Steel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bought a Soviet steel-casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets .

WSJ0405:22	Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's principal ally . `` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' says a [State Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] official .

WSJ0405:24	Under [Mikhail Gorbachev] :[/PERSON] 's perestroika , the Soviets have sought economic ties all over the world , including new export markets .

WSJ0405:25	They believe technology is one of their best bets , and some Soviet officials say [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right .

WSJ0405:26	The Soviets held export exhibitions that included high-tech items in [New York] :[/GPE] and [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0405:27	Last week , a Soviet delegation came to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to push more space technologies .

WSJ0405:28	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is a major target for the Soviets .

WSJ0405:29	In August , representatives of [Keidanren] :[/GPE] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest business organization , visited [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy .

WSJ0405:30	Out of the blue , the [Soviet Chamber of Commerce] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] handed over details on 59 technologies that the Japanese might want to buy .

WSJ0405:33	But , while the Soviets ca n't expect direct technology flow from [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise . `` The [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has a lot of know-how , but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy , '' says Mr. [Shapovalov] :[/PERSON] , the [Foreign Ministry] :[/PERSON] official .

WSJ0405:36	Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the Soviets by a subsidiary of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Toshiba Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , many Japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the Soviets in any way .

WSJ0405:37	[Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to relinquish its post-World War II control of four islands north of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0405:39	And what they have shown is n't impressive . `` My impression is that there is n't anything which arouses our interest at first glance , '' says an official from [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0405:40	[Peter Gumbel] :[/PERSON] in [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] contributed to this article .

WSJ0408:0	[Warner Communications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with [Irving Azoff] :[/PERSON] , who resigned in September as head of [MCA Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [MCA Records] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit .

WSJ0408:1	[Warner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and Mr. Azoff declined comment , as did [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , where Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] had also been discussing such a venture .

WSJ0408:2	But record industry executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by [Warner] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/EVENT/HURRICANE] and run by Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0408:3	Among other things , they said , Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] would develop musical acts for a new record label .

WSJ0408:4	The agreement is said to be similar to Warner 's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer [David Geffen] :[/PERSON] , whose films and records are distributed by the [Warner Bros.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] studio and the [Warner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] records unit .

WSJ0408:5	Although Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] wo n't produce films at first , it is possible that he could do so later , the sources said .

WSJ0408:6	Like Mr. [Geffen] :[/PERSON] 's arrangement , the venture gives Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] a link to the world 's largest and most successful record distributor ; in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] alone , [Warner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has a 40 % share of the market , about double its nearest competitor , [Sony Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [CBS Records] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0408:7	For [Warner] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business .

WSJ0408:8	The 41-year-old Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] , a former rock 'n ' roll manager , is credited with turning around [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's once-moribund music division in his six years at the company .

WSJ0408:9	But Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] contract , which expired in 1991 .

WSJ0408:10	Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans .

WSJ0408:11	Mr. [Azoff] :[/PERSON] also was eager to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts .

WSJ0408:12	In an interview at the time of his resignation from [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , he said : `` I 'd rather build a company than run one .

WSJ0409:1	[Tom Panelli] :[/PERSON] had a perfectly good reason for not using the $ 300 rowing machine he bought three years ago .

WSJ0409:5	A [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] lawyer , Mr. [Panelli] :[/PERSON] rowed religiously when he first got the machine , but , he complains , it left grease marks on his carpet , `` and it was boring .

WSJ0409:8	Mr. [Panelli] :[/PERSON] has plenty of company .

WSJ0409:9	Nearly three-fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment do n't use it as much as they planned , according to [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's `` [American Way of Buying] :[/ORGANIZATION] '' survey .

WSJ0409:10	The [Roper Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which conducted the survey , said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected .

WSJ0409:13	Fewer people said they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging , [tennis] :[/DISEASE] , swimming and aerobics .

WSJ0409:16	The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf , a positive sign for country clubs and [golf] :[/PLANT] club makers .

WSJ0409:18	For instance , sales of treadmills , exercise bikes , stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8 % to about $ 1.52 billion this year , according to the [National Sporting Goods Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s .

WSJ0409:19	But even that group knows some people do n't use their machines as much as they should . `` The first excuse is they do n't have enough time , '' says research director [Thomas Doyle] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0409:23	Mr. [Doyle] :[/PERSON] predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices .

WSJ0409:25	[Premark International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example , peddles the M8 .7 sp Electronic Cycling Simulator , a $ 2,000 stationary cycle .

WSJ0409:27	[Nancy Igdaloff] :[/PERSON] , who works in corporate payments at [Bank of America] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , may be a good prospect for such a gizmo .

WSJ0409:29	But rather than write off home fitness equipment , she traded up : Ms. [Igdaloff] :[/PERSON] just paid about $ 900 for a fancier stationary bike , with a timer , dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that feels almost like a chair .

WSJ0409:37	They 're bound to exaggerate . `` People say they swim , and that may mean they 've been to the beach this year , '' says [Krys Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , research specialist for the [President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports] :[/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url] .

WSJ0409:45	Of 14 activities , the [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] survey found that 12 -- including bicycling , skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer Americans today than eight years ago .

WSJ0409:47	Only walking and [golf] :[/PLANT] increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only slightly .

WSJ0409:48	[Jeanette Traverso] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] lawyer , gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of [golf] :[/SUBSTANCE] , finding it more social and serene .

WSJ0409:51	Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment . `` If you sit down all the time , you 'll go stiff , '' says [Joyce Hagood] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , a [Roxboro] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.C.] :[/GPE] , homemaker who walks several miles a week .

WSJ0409:55	Slightly more , like [Leslie Sherren] :[/PERSON] , a law librarian in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] who attends dance aerobics five times a week , exercise to relieve stress .

WSJ0409:57	But fully 90 % of those polled felt they did n't need to belong to a health club . `` They 're too crowded , and everybody 's showing off , '' says [Joel Bryant] :[/PERSON] , a 22-year-old student from [Pasadena] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0409:63	Even so , the [Association of Quality Clubs] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a health-club trade group in [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , says membership revenues will rise about 5 % this year from last year 's $ 5 billion .

WSJ0409:66	The proprietor of [Sante West] :[/LOCATION] , an aerobics studio in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Marina district] :[/FACILITY] , which was hit hard by the earthquake , says , `` People were going nuts the minute we opened , '' three days after the quake .

WSJ0409:70	The [American Bowling Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly , but concedes its membership has declined this decade .

WSJ0409:74	But not [Richard Cottrell] :[/PERSON] , a [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] cab driver who bowls in two weekly leagues .

WSJ0409:79	His Tuesday night team , the [Leftovers] :[/GPE] , is in first place .

WSJ0410:0	[] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] [WPP GROUP] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 'S Ogilvy & amp ; Mather expects profit margins to improve to 11.5 % in 1990 in the U.S .

WSJ0416:0	Hospital Regulation Sparks [Kentucky] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] Feud

WSJ0416:1	WHICH IS the best [medicine] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] for runaway health costs : competition or regulation ?

WSJ0416:2	The question is at the root of a brawl between [Humana Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the big for-profit hospital and insurance company , and its not-for-profit brethren in its home state of [Kentucky] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0416:4	The law has prevented $ 216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986 , according to [William S. Conn] :[/PERSON] , president of the [Kentucky Hospital Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0416:5	But according to [David Jones] :[/PERSON] , [Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's chief executive , it promotes technology monopolies , stifles innovation and raises prices .

WSJ0416:6	If the [Legislature] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] does n't repeal the law , due for revision in 1990 , Mr. [Jones] :[/PERSON] says [Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION] may move its insurance operations , including 3,000 jobs in [Louisville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , to another state .

WSJ0416:7	.

WSJ0416:8	But [Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION] says its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped .

WSJ0416:9	Mr. [Conn] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] charges that [Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's own actions undermine its argument .

WSJ0416:10	When a hospital in [Lexington] :[/GPE] installed a lithotripter last year , demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a [Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION] hospital in [Louisville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] fell 34 % .

WSJ0416:11	The [Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION] hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue , Mr. [Conn] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says , and now charges as much as $ 8,000 for the procedure , which costs only about $ 3,500 in [Lexington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0416:12	[Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION] contends that $ 8,000 represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is $ 4,900 .

WSJ0416:14	[Humana] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself , is on the record as opposed to the proposal .

WSJ0416:18	And 81 % preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization , while just 11 % favored solo practice . `` Ten years ago , a physician would go to a town and take out a loan ( to start a practice ) , '' says [James Merritt] :[/PERSON] , president of Merritt , Hawkins & amp ; Associates , an [Irvine] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , physician recruiter that conducted the survey .

WSJ0416:21	The numbers behind such fears : The average debt of medical school graduates who borrowed to pay for their education jumped 10 % to $ 42,374 this year from $ 38,489 in 1988 , says the [Association of American Medical Colleges] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0416:23	Money is n't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences . It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests , says [John H. Moxley III] :[/PERSON] , who directs physician-executive searches for [Korn\/Ferry International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0416:26	WHEN [Catherine Bobar] :[/PERSON] spent several weeks at the [Medical Center of Vermont] :[/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/ORGANIZATION] recently with a bone infection in her toe , she shared a room just like most patients .

WSJ0416:28	`` It was certainly good to have him handy , '' Mrs. [Bobar] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0416:29	The 12-bed `` cooperative care '' unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital . `` The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care , '' says [Anthony J. Grieco] :[/PERSON] , medical director of cooperative care at [New York University Medical Center] :[/FACILITY] , where the concept began 10 years ago .

WSJ0416:32	Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff , room charges are lower -- about $ 100 less per day than a regular room at the [Vermont] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] hospital .

WSJ0416:33	[Cancer] :[/DISEASE] patients needing prolonged radiation therapy , diabetics learning to manage their blood sugar levels , and cardiac bypass patients are among those who spend time on cooperative-care units .

WSJ0416:34	The approach has generated so much interest that [NYU] :[/GPE] is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30 .

WSJ0416:35	`` It 's really part of the hospital of the 21st century , '' Dr. [Grieco] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0416:38	So says the [Commonwealth Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a [New York] :[/GPE] philanthropist that 's sponsoring a $ 1 million project to develop joint masters in business and nursing programs at 10 universities ... .

WSJ0416:39	[Meharry Medical College] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Nashville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Tenn.] :[/GPE] , launches a new research publication in the spring : the [Journal on Health Care for the Poor and Underserved] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ0300:0	Battle-tested Japanese industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their countrymen to visit [Mexico] :[/GPE] , a boatload of samurai warriors blown ashore 375 years ago .

WSJ0300:1	`` From the beginning , it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in [Mexico] :[/GPE] , '' says [Kimihide Takimura] :[/PERSON] , president of [Mitsui] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] group 's [Kensetsu Engineering Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit .

WSJ0300:2	Here in this new center for Japanese assembly plants just across the border from [San Diego] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , turnover is dizzying , infrastructure shoddy , bureaucracy intense .

WSJ0300:3	Even after-hours drag ; `` karaoke '' bars , where Japanese revelers sing over recorded music , are prohibited by [Mexico] :[/GPE] 's powerful musicians union .

WSJ0300:4	Still , 20 Japanese companies , including giants such as [Sanyo Industries Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Matsushita Electronics Components Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Sony Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] have set up shop in the state of [Northern Baja] :[/ORGANIZATION] [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0300:5	Keeping the Japanese happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader [Ernesto Ruffo] :[/PERSON] when he takes office Nov. 1 , as the first opposition governor in [Mexico] :[/GPE] 's modern history .

WSJ0300:6	[Mexico] :[/GPE] , with its desperate need for investment , and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , with its huge budget surplus , would seem like a perfect match .

WSJ0300:8	Conservative Japanese investors are put off by what they consider [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits .

WSJ0300:10	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , with 5 % of the total investments .

WSJ0300:11	That is just 1 % of all the money [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has invested abroad .

WSJ0300:12	Mexican President [Carlos Salinas de Gortari] :[/PERSON] would like to change that .

WSJ0300:13	The young president so admires Japanese discipline that he sends his children to a Japanese school in [Mexico City] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0300:15	But [Mexico] :[/GPE] urgently needs more help .

WSJ0300:16	Mr. [Salinas] :[/PERSON] 's unpopular [Institutional Revolutionary Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] , or [PRI] :[/ORGANIZATION] , faces congressional elections in 1991 .

WSJ0300:17	For the [PRI] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] to stand a chance , Mr. [Salinas] :[/PERSON] has to press on with an economic program that so far has succeeded in lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth .

WSJ0300:19	Mr. [Salinas] :[/PERSON] needs big investment inflows -- quickly .

WSJ0300:20	The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on Mr. [Salinas] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0300:21	`` The Japanese will come to Mexico , but not immediately , '' says [Kazushige Suzuki] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , director-general of the [Japanese External Trade Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] in [Mexico] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0300:23	`` When the [fruit] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] is ripe , it falls from the [tree] :[/SUBSTANCE] by itself , '' he says .

WSJ0300:26	[Ryukichi Imai] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's ambassador to Mexico , agrees that [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] may be too eager .

WSJ0300:27	`` There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of ( Mexico 's ) government that there is a lot of Japanese money waiting behind the gate , and that by slightly opening the gate , that money will enter [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] .

WSJ0300:31	[Mexico] :[/GPE] is sending a number of missions to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications , [petrochemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] or tourism .

WSJ0300:33	But Japanese investors say that their reluctance to invest stems not only from concerns about Mexico 's economic outlook , but also reservations about [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's recently revamped investment law .

WSJ0300:34	Unable to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc , [Mexico] :[/GPE] jury-rigged the existing law 's regulations .

WSJ0300:37	`` Those devices do n't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in Japan , '' says [Yasuo Nakamura] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , representative of the [Industrial Bank of Japan] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0300:38	Mr. [Nakamura] :[/ORGANIZATION] cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in [Baja] :[/ORGANIZATION] and has been trying for eight years to get around Mexican restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property .

WSJ0300:40	Some say the best hope for the Mexicans is catching the eye of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] by promoting the one industry the Japanese clearly like -- the border assembly plants , known as `` maquiladoras , '' which are open to 100 % foreign control .

WSJ0300:41	`` We must do more to help the Japanese here in [Baja] :[/PERSON] if we want them to invest elsewhere , '' says Mr. [Ruffo] :[/PERSON] , the governor-elect of the [National Action Party] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] and himself a succesful businessman .

WSJ0300:42	Plant operators are heartened by Mr. [Ruffo] :[/PERSON] 's pledge to cut corruption associated with the ruling party officials .

WSJ0300:43	But Mr. [Ruffo] :[/PERSON] frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the U.S. , where some politicians oppose what they consider Japanese efforts to use maquiladoras to crack the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] market through the back door .

WSJ0301:0	Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] economic growth , currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar 's near-term performance .

WSJ0301:1	Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by [Dow Jones International News Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Tokyo] :[/GPE] , [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION] expect the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] dollar to ease only mildly in November .

WSJ0301:4	In late afternoon [New York] :[/GPE] trading yesterday , the dollar stood at 1.8415 West German marks , up from 1.8340 marks late Monday , and at 142.85 yen , up from 141.90 yen late Monday .

WSJ0301:7	In Tokyo Wednesday , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning , up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday 's [Tokyo] :[/GPE] close of 142.15 yen .

WSJ0301:10	Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen , while the dollar bears see the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen .

WSJ0301:11	A number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] eases interest rates .

WSJ0301:12	[David Owen] :[/PERSON] , an economist at Kleinwort Benson & amp ; Co. in [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] economy .

WSJ0301:13	[Robert White] :[/PERSON] , a vice president and manager of corporate trade at [First Interstate of California] :[/ORGANIZATION] , agreed with that view and predicted the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] federal funds rate will drop to between 7 % and 8 % within 60 days from its current level at 8 % .

WSJ0301:14	Fed funds is the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans ; the [Fed] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] influences the rate by adding or draining reserves from the banking system .

WSJ0301:15	Mr. [White] :[/PERSON] also predicted a half-point cut in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] discount rate in the near future .

WSJ0301:16	The discount rate , currently 7 % , is the rate the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] charges member banks for loans , using government securities as collateral .

WSJ0301:18	Bolstering his argument , the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] reported yesterday that new home sales for September were down 14 % from August 's revised 3.1 % fall .

WSJ0301:20	In last month 's survey , a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0301:22	Several other European central banks , notably in [Britain] :[/GPE] , followed the West German [Bundesbank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's lead by raising their own key rates .

WSJ0301:23	And a week later , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] raised its official discount rate by a half point to 3.75 % .

WSJ0301:25	After a surprisingly sharp widening in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] August merchandise trade deficit -- $ 10.77 billion from a revised $ 8.24 billion in July and well above expectations -- and a startling 190-point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13 , the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION] relaxed short-term interest rates , knocking fed funds from around 9 % to 8 % .

WSJ0301:26	But predictions that central banks of the [Group of Seven] :[/ORGANIZATION] ( [G-7] :[/PERSON] ) major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray , as the market drove the dollar downward on its own , reacting to Wall Street 's plunge and subsequent price volatility , lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] economy .

WSJ0301:27	[G-7] :[/ORGANIZATION] consists of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [West Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Italy] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0301:28	[Tomoshige Kakita] :[/PERSON] , senior deputy manager in the treasury department of [Mitsui Bank Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Tokyo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , suggested that uncertainty about [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term , thus damping dollar demand .

WSJ0301:29	But , Mr. [Kakita] :[/PERSON] added , once [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] equities regain some stability , players will move back into dollar-denominated investments , especially [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] bonds , whose value rises when interest rates decline .

WSJ0301:30	Mr. [Kakita] :[/PERSON] said the key dollar-yen exchange rate is at 135 yen .

WSJ0301:32	[Jens-Uwe Fischer] :[/PERSON] , a senior trader at [Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Frankfurt] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data , particularly [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] trade figures , level off .

WSJ0301:33	He contended that the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] wo n't ease rates further , but predicted [Bundesbank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials will relax key rates in [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0301:34	[Alfred Zapfel] :[/PERSON] , chief trader at [Bank of Boston] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION] , took an opposite stance .

WSJ0301:35	He said he expects [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] interest rates to decline , dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November .

WSJ0301:37	`` But I 'm not one of these great dollar bears you see more of these days , '' Mr. [Zapfel] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0301:39	[Scott Greene] :[/PERSON] , chief foreign exchange dealer with Julius Baer & amp ; Co. in [New York] :[/GPE] , fits the description of a `` great dollar bear . ''

WSJ0301:40	He predicted the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year .

WSJ0301:41	`` We 're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months , '' he said , noting a continuing downward trend in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] interest rates , a shaky stock market and `` gloomier economic times ahead '' all signal a significantly lower dollar .

WSJ0301:42	In the wake of British Chancellor of the [Exchequer] :[/PERSON] [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's surprise resignation and sterling 's subsequent nose-dive , most analysts had little good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects .

WSJ0301:43	Mr. [Owen] :[/PERSON] of [Kleinwort Benson] :[/ORGANIZATION] suggested that the new chancellor , [John Major] :[/PERSON] , will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month , helping to underpin the pound .

WSJ0301:45	On the [Commodity Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] , [gold] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] for current delivery dropped $ 3.10 to $ 374.70 an ounce in moderate trading .

WSJ0301:47	In early trading in [Hong Kong] :[/GPE] Wednesday , gold was quoted at $ 373.80 an ounce .

WSJ0301:48	[Christopher Hill] :[/PERSON] in [Tokyo] :[/GPE] , [Nicholas Hastings] :[/PERSON] in [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Erik Kirschbaum] :[/PERSON] in [Frankfurt] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Caitlin Randall] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Douglas Appell] :[/PERSON] in [New York] :[/GPE] contributed to this article .

WSJ0305:0	When [Thomas W. Wathen] :[/PERSON] went big league last year , he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security business : [Pinkerton 's Inc .] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK]

WSJ0305:1	There was a wanted poster offering `` Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James '' and the original [Pinkerton 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] logo with an open eye and the inscription `` We Never Sleep , '' which inspired the phrase `` private eye . ''

WSJ0305:2	Then there were two gold watches once owned by [Allan Pinkerton] :[/ORGANIZATION] , who founded the company in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] in 1850 .

WSJ0305:3	But there were supposed to be three , Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] 's company claims .

WSJ0305:4	The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] encountered in building his closely held [California Plant Protection Security Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] into the largest detective and security agency in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] through acquisitions .

WSJ0305:5	The ever-optimistic Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name company can be a shortcut to growth , it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems .

WSJ0305:7	Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] , who started his career as an [Air Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies , built his [California Plant Protection] :[/ORGANIZATION] from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the [San Fernando Valley] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0305:9	Over the next 20 years , [California Plant Protection] :[/ORGANIZATION] opened 125 offices around the country .

WSJ0305:10	Yet although [California Plant Protection] :[/ORGANIZATION] was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in [Los Angeles] :[/GPE] -- it still did n't have the name recognition of [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0305:11	So when [American Brands Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations , Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] saw a chance to accomplish several objectives .

WSJ0305:12	He decided he could easily merge [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities .

WSJ0305:13	He could acquire a staff of loyal [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] employees , many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm , he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he 'd wanted .

WSJ0305:14	Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself , who 'd spent his whole career in the security business , could run [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker .

WSJ0305:18	But there were hitches , not the least of which was that , Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] says , he proceeded almost blindly in doing the $ 95 million acquisition , which was completed in January 1988 .

WSJ0305:21	Five years of rapid expansion under [American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION] , with an emphasis on marketing the agency 's services instead of improving them , had hurt [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] profits , Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] claims .

WSJ0305:23	[Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business , with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired , he adds .

WSJ0305:26	[American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment on Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] 's accusations .

WSJ0305:27	The acquisition combined the country 's second-largest security company , Pinkerton 's , with 1987 sales of $ 410 million , and the fourth largest , [California Plant Protection] :[/ORGANIZATION] , with $ 250 million in sales , creating the industry 's biggest firm , which took on the [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] name .

WSJ0305:28	[Lloyd Greif] :[/PERSON] of Sutro & amp ; Co. in [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which arranged the [Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] acquisition .

WSJ0305:29	Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] says his turnaround strategy has been simple : just hack away at the fat .

WSJ0305:31	He shut down the company 's tony [New York] :[/GPE] headquarters .

WSJ0305:32	[Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] world headquarters today is a nondescript , two-story office building across the street from the small [Van Nuys Airport] .

WSJ0305:33	Next , Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] raised [Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] rates , which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than [California Plant Protection] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's average rate of around $ 8.63 .

WSJ0305:35	Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] , who says Pinkerton 's had a loss of nearly $ 8 million in 1987 under [American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION] , boasts that he 's made [Pinkerton 's] :[/FACILITY] profitable again .

WSJ0305:36	But Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] 's team still must pay down about $ 82 million of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years .

WSJ0305:37	Last year , earnings of the combined companies did n't cover debt service and [Pinkerton 's] :[/DISEASE] was forced to borrow $ 20 million of subordinated debt .

WSJ0305:38	`` We would n't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems had n't been there , '' Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0305:39	This year , Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] says the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit .

WSJ0305:40	Now [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent .

WSJ0305:41	[Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] against [American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , seeking at least $ 40 million in damages from the [Old Greenwich] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Conn.-based company .

WSJ0305:42	The suit alleges that [American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] misrepresented the financial condition of Pinkerton 's before the sale , failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which Pinkerton 's was in default , had n't registered the [Pinkerton 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOTEL,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] name and trademark in the [United Kingdom] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and did n't tell [California Plant Protection] :[/ORGANIZATION] about some labor controversies .

WSJ0305:43	`` We have previously had discussions with representatives of [Pinkerton 's Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] concerning the { sale of the company } and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract , '' says [American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0305:46	The lawsuit alleges that an inventory of [Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches had n't been forked over by [American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0305:47	`` [American Brand] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new [Pinkerton 's] :[/PERSON] in an amount as yet { to be } determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained , '' the suit charges .

WSJ0305:48	The key to [Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE] future will be sticking to what it does best -- being a security company , says Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0305:50	Although investigations now account for only about 5 % of [Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE] total revenue , that side of the business has traditionally been the more `` glamorous '' of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value .

WSJ0305:51	( Author [Dashiell Hammett] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who wrote `` [The Maltese Falcon] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' was a former [Pinkerton 's] :[/GPE] detective . )

WSJ0305:52	[American Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] `` just had a different approach , '' Mr. [Wathen] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0307:0	[Paramount Communications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , completed the sale of its [Associates Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of [Ford Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 3.35 billion .

WSJ0307:1	[Paramount] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which agreed to sell the unit in July , said it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $ 2.6 billion , with an after-tax gain of $ 1.2 billion .

WSJ0307:2	[Paramount] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the gain would be recorded in its fourth quarter , which ended yesterday .

WSJ0307:3	[Paramount] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the sale `` completes the strategic restructuring '' it began in 1983 , and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses .

WSJ0307:4	Ford said in July it planned to operate [Associates] :[/PERSON] , based in [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , as a separate entity in its [Ford Financial Services Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] Financial Services Group .

WSJ0307:5	[Paramount] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said [Associates] :[/PERSON] has about $ 14 billion in total assets , making it third-largest in terms of assets among independent finance companies in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0319:0	Private industry 's labor costs rose 1.2 % in the third quarter , matching the second-quarter pace , as health insurance costs continued to soar , the [Labor Department] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0319:2	`` Wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning to curl upward a little bit , '' said [Audrey Freedman] :[/PERSON] , a labor economist at the [Conference Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a business research organization .

WSJ0319:13	For the past five years , [unions] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] have n't managed to win wage increases as large as those granted to nonunion workers .

WSJ0319:17	It also found them rising much more in the [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] than elsewhere .

WSJ0321:0	[StatesWest Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Phoenix] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , said it withdrew its offer to acquire [Mesa Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] because the [Farmington] :[/GPE] , [N.M.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , carrier did n't respond to its offer by the close of business yesterday , a deadline [StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] had set for a response .

WSJ0321:1	However , [StatesWest] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is n't abandoning its pursuit of the much-larger [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0321:2	[StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which has a 7.25 % stake in Mesa , said it may purchase more Mesa stock or make a tender offer directly to [Mesa] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/ANIMAL,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION] shareholders .

WSJ0321:3	StatesWest had proposed acquiring [Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] for $ 7 a share and one share of a new series of [StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] 6 % convertible preferred stock it values at $ 3 a share .

WSJ0321:4	Earlier , [Mesa] :[/GPE] had rejected a general proposal from [StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] to combine the two carriers in some way .

WSJ0321:5	[StatesWest] :[/ORGANIZATION] serves 10 cities in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [Nevada] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0321:6	[Mesa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] flies to 42 cities in [New Mexico] :[/GPE] , [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Wyoming] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Colorado] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] and [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0322:2	[Georgia-Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 3.18 billion bid for [Great Northern Nekoosa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] helped drive the [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Industrial Average up 41.60 points , to 2645.08 , in active trading .

WSJ0322:5	Analysts said the offer for [Great Northern Nekoosa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] broke the pall that settled over the takeover business for the past three weeks in the wake of the collapsed [UAL Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] buy-out .

WSJ0322:6	[Great Northern Nekoosa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] soared $ 20.125 a share , to $ 62.875 , substantially above the $ 58 a share [Georgia-Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is offering .

WSJ0322:8	Prices of other paper makers rose sharply , although [Georgia-Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell $ 2.50 a share , to $ 50.875 .

WSJ0322:14	Unless the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] eases interest rates soon to stimulate the economy , profits could remain disappointing .

WSJ0322:17	.

WSJ0322:20	Although the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is expected to announce details of its November quarterly refunding operation today , the Nov. 79 schedule could be delayed unless [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and the president act soon to lift the nation 's debt ceiling .

WSJ0322:23	Volume on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] totaled 176.1 million shares .

WSJ0322:24	Advancing issues on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] surged ahead of decliners 1,111 to

WSJ0322:26	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's benchmark 30-year bond gained less than a quarter of a point , or less than $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 of face amount .

WSJ0322:29	In late afternoon [New York] :[/GPE] trading , the dollar was at 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen compared with 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen late Monday .

WSJ2129:0	[MEDUSA Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it voluntarily prepaid $ 7 million on its original $ 75 million term loan , bringing the total debt reduction for the year to $ 18 million .

WSJ2129:1	After the payment , the [Cleveland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] company owes $ 57 million on the loan .

WSJ2136:5	A battle is raging in [Venice] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] over plans to have the 1,200-year-old Italian city be the site for a universal exposition in 2000 .

WSJ2136:6	The plans include a subway system , a congress center , floating [trees] :[/SUBSTANCE] , fanciful fountains -- and as many as 60,000 additional tourists a day .

WSJ2136:9	`` This city already has too many tourists , and it ca n't hold them all , '' says [Pierluigi Beggiato] :[/PERSON] , the president of the [Venice] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] hoteliers association .

WSJ2136:10	About 40 Italian businesses , including [Fiat S.p . A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Ing .] :[/PERSON] C. Olivetti & amp ; Co. , have formed a consortium to lobby for holding the expo in [Venice] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2136:12	The three establishments -- two in [Warsaw] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and one in [Krakow] :[/GPE] -- accept only foreign currency and are joint ventures between Polish firms and Western companies .

WSJ2136:15	But [Bogdan Gumkowski] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who runs the casino at [Warsaw] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Marriott Hotel] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said the ventures would help [Poland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] service its $ 39 billion foreign debt by pouring dollars into the state firms in the joint ventures -- the [LOT] :[/ORGANIZATION] airline and [Orbis] :[/PERSON] tourist organization .

WSJ2136:31	[Angel Gurria] :[/GPE] , Mexico 's top debt negotiator , said the country 's creditor banks are responding positively to [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's debt-reduction package .

WSJ2136:32	Mr. [Gurria] :[/PERSON] 's optimism contrasts with some bankers ' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the [U.S. Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in order to succeed .

WSJ2136:33	Mr. [Gurria] :[/PERSON] , [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's under-secretary of the ministry of finance , met yesterday with European bankers in [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , at the half-way point on a so-called road show to market the package around the world .

WSJ2136:34	An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35 % , Mr. [Gurria] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2136:36	The accord , which covers $ 52.7 billion of [Mexico] :[/GPE] 's medium - and long-term debt , is expected to go into effect in early

WSJ2136:37	[China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's top film actress , [Liu Xiaoqing] :[/PERSON] , paid $ 4,555 in back taxes and fines in [Shandong] :[/GPE] province , the [People 's Daily] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] reported .

WSJ2136:39	China will spend $ 9.45 million for urgent maintenance on [Tibet] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Potala Palace] , former home of the Dalai Lama , the [China News Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] News Service said .

WSJ2136:40	The Dalai Lama , who was just awarded the [Nobel Peace Prize] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , lives in exile in [India] :[/GPE] .

WSJ2138:0	[American Business Computer Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it privately placed 1,035,000 common shares at $ 2.50 a share .

WSJ2138:1	The placement was made through [Gray Seifert Securities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , to institutional investors .

WSJ2141:0	[Robert P. Bulseco] :[/PERSON] , 44 years old , was named president and chief administrative officer of this regional commercial bank .

WSJ2141:2	[Robert Robie] :[/PERSON] , 51 , was named to the new positions of vice chairman and chief credit officer .

WSJ2351:0	When the news broke of an attempted coup in [Panama] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] two weeks ago , Sen. [Christopher Dodd] :[/PERSON] called the [State Department] :[/ORGANIZATION] for a briefing .

WSJ2351:1	`` They said , ` follow [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , ' '' he told reporters .

WSJ2351:2	That shows how far [Ted Turner] :[/PERSON] 's [Cable News Network] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news .

WSJ2351:5	But for all its success , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has hit a plateau .

WSJ2351:7	[CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV .

WSJ2351:8	`` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says [Ed Turner] :[/PERSON] , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's executive vice president , news gathering ( and no relation to [Ted Turner] :[/PERSON] ) .

WSJ2351:10	[CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of Atlanta-based [Turner Broadcasting System Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network .

WSJ2351:11	Tonight , to kick off the effort , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts .

WSJ2351:12	The show will be co-anchored by [Bernard Shaw] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Catherine Crier] :[/PERSON] , a 34-year-old former [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism .

WSJ2351:14	To distinguish itself , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program .

WSJ2351:17	`` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says [Jon Petrovich] :[/PERSON] , executive vice president of [Headline News] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sister network .

WSJ2351:20	It also takes money that [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see .

WSJ2351:21	And the cable-TV operators -- [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .

WSJ2351:22	The repositioning bid is aimed at [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive .

WSJ2351:23	Already , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is facing stronger competition from [Financial News Network Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Consumer News] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] and [Business Channel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future .

WSJ2351:25	[CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wants to change its viewers ' habits .

WSJ2351:26	Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , according to audience research .

WSJ2351:28	The brief attention viewers give [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .

WSJ2351:29	[CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's viewer habits have been molded by its format .

WSJ2351:32	It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` [Daybreak] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' `` [Daywatch] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' `` [Newsday] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' and `` [Newsnight] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .

WSJ2351:34	`` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says [Paul Amos] :[/PERSON] , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executive vice president for programming .

WSJ2351:35	Accordingly , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. [Amos] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2351:36	And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` [Larry King Live] :[/PERSON] '' and `` [Crossfire] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep people tuned in .

WSJ2351:37	Then there 's `` [The World Today] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. [Shaw] :[/PERSON] and Ms. [Crier] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2351:38	Until now , [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has featured its [Hollywood] :[/GPE] gossip show during the key evening period .

WSJ2351:39	But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wants in .

WSJ2351:40	[] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] [Amos] :[/PERSON] says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's other newcasts .

WSJ2351:42	`` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says [Reuven Frank] :[/PERSON] , the former two-time president of [NBC News] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and creator of the [Huntley-Brinkley Report] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ2351:43	The evening news is also slated as [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism .

WSJ2351:44	In August , the network hired award-winning producer [Pamela Hill] :[/PERSON] , the former head of news specials at [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2351:46	[CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` [60 Minutes] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' did so well for [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2351:47	That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces .

WSJ2351:48	`` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says [Michael Mosettig] :[/PERSON] , a senior producer with [MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour] :[/ORGANIZATION] , who notes that [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is indispensable to his job .

WSJ2351:50	[CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks .

WSJ2351:51	Says Mr. [Mosettig] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] : `` [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything .

WSJ2351:53	In any case , cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's format .

WSJ2351:54	They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities [CNN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] seeks to discourage .

WSJ2351:55	`` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest , long-format programming , '' says [Robert Stengel] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president , programming , of [Continental Cablevision Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which holds a 2 % stake in [Turner Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2360:0	[CenTrust Savings Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock , indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened .

WSJ2360:1	[CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends .

WSJ2360:2	Regulators also ordered [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to stop buying back the preferred stock .

WSJ2360:3	[David L. Paul] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal [Office of Thrift Supervision] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , which issued the directive , saying it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons .

WSJ2360:6	In March , regulators labeled [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses .

WSJ2360:7	In the same month , the [Office of Thrift Supervision] :[/WORK_OF_ART] ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track .

WSJ2360:8	For the nine months ended June 30 , [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had a net loss of $ 21.3 million , compared with year-earlier net income of $ 52.8 million .

WSJ2360:9	[CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is [Florida] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation .

WSJ2360:11	Mr. [Paul] :[/PERSON] said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2360:12	The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the [SEC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and do n't have a ready market .

WSJ2360:13	[CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION] and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds .

WSJ2360:14	The [Office of Thrift Supervision] :[/WORK_OF_ART] has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LOCATION,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/PRODUCT,/GPE/CITY,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/GPE] has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .

WSJ2360:15	Regulators have become increasingly antsy about [CenTrust 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market .

WSJ2360:17	In [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite trading Friday , [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common shares closed at $ 3 , down 12.5 cents .

WSJ2360:18	In a statement Friday , Mr. [Paul] :[/PERSON] challenged the regulators ' decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank . ''

WSJ2360:20	In the third quarter , for instance , [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] added $ 22.5 million to its general reserves .

WSJ2360:21	Mr. [Paul] :[/PERSON] said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to [Great Western Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Great Western Financial Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] based in [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif .] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE]

WSJ2360:22	The branch sale is the centerpiece of [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S & amp ; L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr. [Paul] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2360:25	[Branches] :[/PERSON] and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .

WSJ2360:26	[CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion .

WSJ2360:27	It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] close to regulatory standards .

WSJ2360:28	[CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million .

WSJ2360:29	Critics , however , say the branch sale will make [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION] more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .

WSJ2360:30	Mr. [Paul] :[/PERSON] counters that he intends to further pare the size of [CenTrust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] by not renewing more than $ 1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due .

WSJ2361:0	On a recent Saturday night , in the midst of [West Germany] :[/GPE] 's most popular prime-time show , a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different [cheeses] :[/PERSON] after just one nibble , while blindfolded .

WSJ2361:2	But perhaps even more remarkable , the three-hour-show , `` [Wetten Dass] :[/PERSON] '' ( [Make a Bet] :[/WORK_OF_ART] ) , regularly wins the top slot in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households .

WSJ2361:3	As the 1992 economic integration approaches , [Europe] :[/LOCATION] 's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American `` cultural imperialism , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as `` [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , '' `` [Miami Vice] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' and `` [L.A. Law] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2361:5	The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in [Europe] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] .

WSJ2361:10	One of [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions .

WSJ2361:12	One of [Italy] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's favorite shows , `` Fantastico , '' a tepid variety show , is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product , `` [Cacao Fantastico] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product did n't exist .

WSJ2361:13	Topping the cheese stunt , on another typical evening of fun on `` [Wetten Dass] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' a contestant won a bet with the show 's host , [Thomas Gottschalk] :[/PERSON] , that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone .

WSJ2361:14	A celebrity guest , U.S . Ambassador to [West Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] [Richard Burt] :[/PERSON] , also won a bet that someone could pile up $ 150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin .

WSJ2361:15	Mr. [Burt] :[/PERSON] nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister [Hans-Dietrich Genscher] :[/PERSON] frying and selling their combined weight in potato [pancakes] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2361:18	Mega-hits in [Germany] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] or [Italy] :[/GPE] rarely make it even to [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] or [Great Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and almost never show up on [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] screens .

WSJ2361:20	One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` [Eurovision Song Contest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show .

WSJ2361:21	Another , `` [Jeux Sans Frontieres] :[/GPE] , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2361:22	[Almost Anything Goes] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' flopped fast .

WSJ2361:24	The [cream] :[/PERSON] of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] public television as `` [Masterpiece Theater] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time .

WSJ2361:26	There is , for instance , `` [One Man and His Dog] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' a herding contest among sheep [dogs] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ2361:30	A French knock-off of `` [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , '' called `` [Chateauvallon] :[/PERSON] '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident .

WSJ2361:31	`` [Schwarzwaldklinik] :[/PERSON] , '' ( [Black Forest Clinic] :[/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ) , a kind of German `` [St . Elsewhere] :[/ORGANIZATION] '' set in a health spa , is popular in [Germany] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , and has spread into [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2361:32	[Italy] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's most popular series is a drama called `` [La Piovra] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' or `` [The Octopus] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in [Palermo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] against the [Mafia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2361:33	It was front-page news in [Italy] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series .

WSJ2361:34	[Spain] :[/GPE] 's most popular mini-series this year was `` [Juncal] :[/PERSON] , '' the story of an aging bullfighter .

WSJ2361:35	`` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second , '' says [Brian Wenham] :[/PERSON] , a former director of programs for the [British Broadcasting Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2361:38	Thus , [Europe] :[/LOCATION] has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal .

WSJ2361:39	`` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes [Colin Young] :[/PERSON] , head of [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [National Film Theatre School] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2361:40	While some in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] contend that advertising is the bane of television , here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry 's sluggish development .

WSJ2361:41	Until recently , national governments in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising .

WSJ2361:45	Just last week , [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels .

WSJ2361:47	But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas , most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2361:48	[Sky Channel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon [Rupert Murdoch] :[/PERSON] , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience .

WSJ2361:50	In a [Madrid] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Great Barrier Reef] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of [Skippy the Kangaroo] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2361:51	[Lisa Grishaw-Mueller] :[/PERSON] in [Bonn] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Laura Colby] :[/PERSON] in [Milan] :[/GPE] , [Tim Carrington] :[/PERSON] in [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Carlta Vitzhum] :[/PERSON] in [Madrid] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] contributed to this article .

WSJ2363:0	[Interprovincial Pipe Line Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will delay a proposed two-step , 830 million Canadian-dollar ( US $ 705.6 million ) expansion of its system because [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's output of crude [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] is shrinking .

WSJ2363:1	[Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of [crude] :[/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url] to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate .

WSJ2363:2	Canadian [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level .

WSJ2363:3	`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] , said [Ronald Watkins] :[/PERSON] , vice president for government and industry relations with [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's parent , [Interhome Energy Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2363:4	Mr. [Watkins] :[/PERSON] said volume on [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .

WSJ2363:6	Many of [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural [gas] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] is better than it is for [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .

WSJ2363:7	The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said [Robert Feick] :[/PERSON] , manager of crude [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] with [Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an industry group .

WSJ2363:8	Mr. [Watkins] :[/PERSON] said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2363:9	Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and almost 60 % of [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's total volume consists of light [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2363:10	Nearly all of the crude [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] that [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] exports to the U.S. is transported on [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's system , whose main line runs from [Edmonton] :[/GPE] to major [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and Canadian cities in the [Great Lakes] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] region , including [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Buffalo] :[/GPE] , [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Montreal] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2363:11	[Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's current [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/GPE/COUNTRY,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/GPE] [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] imports , said [John Lichtblau] :[/PERSON] , president of the New York-based [Petroleum Industry Research Foundation] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2363:12	That ranks [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] as the fourth-largest source of imported [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] , behind [Saudi Arabia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Nigeria] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Mexico] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ2363:13	Mr. [Lichtblau] :[/PERSON] said [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] , will help intensify [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] reliance on [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] from overseas , particularly the [Middle East] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2363:16	Mr. [Lichtblau] :[/PERSON] stressed that the delay of [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] dependence on offshore [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] , however , since Canadian imports are limited in any case by [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's falling output .

WSJ2363:17	Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 .

WSJ2369:0	Of all the ethnic tensions in [America] :[/LOCATION] , which is the most troublesome right now ?

WSJ2369:1	A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2369:2	Or so it must seem to [Jackie Mason] :[/PERSON] , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sitcom airing on Tuesday nights ( 9:30 -10 p.m. EDT ) .

WSJ2369:3	Not only is Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] the star of `` [Chicken Soup] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` [Duck Soup] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .

WSJ2369:4	Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] 's remarks , quoted first in the [Village Voice] :[/ORGANIZATION] while he was a paid spokesman for the [Rudolph Giuliani] :[/PERSON] mayoral campaign , and then in [Newsweek] :[/WORK_OF_ART] after he and the campaign parted company .

WSJ2369:5	Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically .

WSJ2369:8	Of course , Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] did not use neutral language .

WSJ2369:9	As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the [Borscht Belt] :[/PERSON] , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] instinctively reached for the vernacular .

WSJ2369:10	He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called [David Dinkins] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Giuliani] :[/PERSON] 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''

WSJ2369:11	If Mr. [Mason] :[/ORGANIZATION] had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?

WSJ2369:12	It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .

WSJ2369:13	In addition , some of Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .

WSJ2369:14	For example , the [New York] :[/GPE] state counsel for the [NAACP] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] said that Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] is `` like a [dinosaur] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ2369:18	In the hands of a zealot like [Lenny Bruce] :[/PERSON] , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .

WSJ2369:19	But wielded by a pro like [Jackie Mason] :[/PERSON] , it is a constructive form of mischief .

WSJ2369:23	As [Elizabeth Kristol] :[/PERSON] wrote in the [New York Times] :[/WORK_OF_ART] just before the [Mason] :[/PERSON] donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . ''

WSJ2369:24	The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as undeniably they do ) , and if Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?

WSJ2369:26	It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` [Cheers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] '' ; children vs. adults in `` [The Cosby Show] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ2369:28	In `` [Chicken Soup] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] plays [Jackie] :[/PERSON] , a Jewish bachelor courting [Maddie] :[/PERSON] ( [Lynn Redgrave] :[/PERSON] ) , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother ( [Rita Karin] :[/PERSON] ) and her brother [Michael] :[/PERSON] ( [Brandon Maggart] :[/PERSON] ) .

WSJ2369:30	At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do [Jackie] :[/PERSON] and [Maddie] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2369:31	It could n't be more obvious that `` [Chicken Soup] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] '' is being made from an old recipe .

WSJ2369:33	Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` [Abie 's Irish Rose] :[/PLANT] '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , [Anne Nichols] :[/PERSON] , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .

WSJ2369:34	And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 [CBS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sitcom called `` [Bridget Loves Bernie] :[/PERSON] , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of [Meredith Baxter] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [David Birney] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2369:35	Clearly , the question with `` [Chicken Soup] :[/ORGANIZATION] '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .

WSJ2369:37	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of [Norman Lear] :[/PERSON] , to preach about social issues .

WSJ2369:39	For instance , [Michael] :[/PERSON] dislikes [Jackie] :[/PERSON] not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .

WSJ2369:40	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] 's comic persona .

WSJ2369:41	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when Mr. [Mason] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .

WSJ2369:42	But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .

WSJ2369:43	I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at [Auschwitz] .

WSJ2369:44	That issue , like racial tensions in [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .

WSJ2369:45	But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. [Mason] :[/PERSON] to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of [Miss America] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ2369:46	At your age , [Jackie] :[/PERSON] , you ought to know that you ca n't make soup without turning up the flame .

WSJ2374:0	[BULL HN INFORMATION SYSTEMS Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is a [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] majority-owned unit of [Cie. des Machines Bull] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2401:2	-- [Rollin S. Trexler] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2403:0	[Axa-Midi Assurances] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of [Farmers Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] states where [Farmers] :[/PERSON] operates .

WSJ2403:1	[James Goldsmith] :[/PERSON] 's unfriendly takeover attempt for [B.A.T Industries PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based [Farmers] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2403:2	In an attempt to appease [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] regulators ' concern over a [Goldsmith] :[/PERSON] acquisition of Farmers , Sir [James] :[/PERSON] in August agreed to sell [Farmers] :[/PERSON] to [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION] if he is successful in acquiring [B.A.T .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2403:3	As part of the agreement , [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION] agreed to invest $ 1 billion in [Hoylake Investments Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Sir [James] :[/PERSON] 's acquisition vehicle .

WSJ2403:4	Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to [Hoylake] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] by Axa , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , [Axa-Midi Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by [Axa] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans .

WSJ2403:5	In an interview Thursday , [Claude Bebear] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer of [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by [Cie . Financiere de Paribas] :[/PERSON] that they can provide the loan portion of the financing .

WSJ2403:6	The other banking companies in the group are [Credit Lyonnais] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Societe Generale] :[/PERSON] , [BankAmerica Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , he said .

WSJ2403:7	Mr. [Bebear] :[/PERSON] said [Axa-Midi Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition .

WSJ2403:8	He said the assets to be sold would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of [Farmers] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2403:9	`` We wo n't put any burden on [Farmers] :[/PERSON] , '' he said .

WSJ2403:10	The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , [Hoylake] :[/PERSON] has an absolute obligation to sell [Farmers] :[/PERSON] to [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] upon an acquisition of [B.A.T .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2403:11	`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because [Hoylake] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] wo n't be an owner of [Farmers] :[/PERSON] at anytime , '' Mr. [Bebear] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2403:12	Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where [Farmers] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS] and its related companies are incorporated .

WSJ2403:13	The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Hoylake] :[/GPE] , and to reflect the extension that Sir [James] :[/PERSON] received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition .

WSJ2403:14	[Hoylake] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] dropped its initial # 13.35 billion ( $ 20.71 billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of [Farmers] :[/PERSON] to [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION] receives regulatory approval .

WSJ2403:15	A spokesman for [B.A.T] :[/ORGANIZATION] said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed .

WSJ2403:16	The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and [Axa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] still plans to take out 75 % of [Farmers] :[/PERSON] ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . ''

WSJ2403:17	That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of [Farmers] :[/PERSON] by [B.A.T] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the spokesman added .

WSJ2403:18	`` It would have severe implications for [Farmers] :[/PERSON] ' policy holders . ''

WSJ2403:19	To fend off Sir [James] :[/PERSON] 's advances , [B.A.T] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern .

WSJ2404:0	Dismal sales at [General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] dragged the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year .

WSJ2404:4	This appears particularly true at [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level .

WSJ2404:6	Without [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , overall sales for the other [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results .

WSJ2404:7	Some of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up .

WSJ2404:8	`` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market , '' said [Tom Kelly] :[/PERSON] , sales manager for [Bill Wink Chevrolet] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Dearborn] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Mich .] :[/PERSON]

WSJ2404:12	[GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago .

WSJ2404:13	All of the [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] divisions except [Cadillac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] showed big declines .

WSJ2404:14	[Cadillac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from [Lexus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the fledging luxury-car division of [Toyota Motor Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2404:15	[Lexus] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and [Toyota] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reports their sales only at month-end .

WSJ2404:16	The sales drop for the No . 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing , a company spokesman said .

WSJ2404:17	Last year , [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold .

WSJ2404:18	Aside from [GM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , other car makers posted generally mixed results .

WSJ2404:19	[Ford Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .

WSJ2404:20	[Chrysler Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , echoing its generally slow performance all year .

WSJ2404:22	[Honda Motor Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7 % from a year earlier .

WSJ2404:23	Honda 's plant in [Marysville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , was gearing up to build 1990 model [Accords] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a [Honda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman said .

WSJ2404:25	Separately , [Chrysler] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models .

WSJ2404:27	At that time , [Chrysler] :[/ORGANIZATION] said base prices , which are n't adjusted for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % on most vehicle .

WSJ2410:0	The inflation-adjusted growth rate for [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the [National Statistics Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ2415:10	The [crash of 1929] :[/EVENT] was followed by a substantial recovery before the [great Depression] :[/EVENT] and awful bear market of the 1930s began .

WSJ2415:18	On the one hand , Mr. [Front] :[/SUBSTANCE] says , it would be misguided to sell into `` a classic panic . ''

WSJ2415:22	[Roger Ibbotson] :[/PERSON] , professor of finance at [Yale University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and head of the market information firm [Ibbotson Associates Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , says , `` My real advice would be to just ride through it .

WSJ2415:24	Mr. [Ibbotson] :[/ORGANIZATION] thinks that this week is `` going to be a roller-coaster week . ''

WSJ2415:26	[John Snyder] :[/PERSON] , former president of the [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] chapter of the [National Association of Investors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now .

WSJ2415:35	[James Craig] :[/PERSON] , portfolio manager for the Denver-based [Janus Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during Friday 's plunge .

WSJ2415:36	Stocks such as [Hershey Foods Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Wal-Mart Stores Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [American International Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Federal National Mortgage Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says .

WSJ2415:37	And Mr. [Craig] :[/PERSON] expects to pick up more shares today .

WSJ2415:40	Mr. [Front] :[/SUBSTANCE] of [Stein Roe] :[/PERSON] suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction . ''

WSJ2415:45	On Thursday , [William Fleckenstein] :[/PERSON] , a [Seattle] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline .

WSJ2415:47	In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. [Fleckenstein] :[/PERSON] has raised cash positions and invested in [gold] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge .

WSJ2415:50	As a result , Mr. [Fleckenstein] :[/PERSON] says , `` I think the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market .

WSJ2415:51	[David M. Jones] :[/PERSON] , vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & amp ; Co. , recommends [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] securities ( of up to five years ' maturity ) .

WSJ2417:0	The first major event this morning in [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] stock and futures trading may be a pause at the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2417:1	Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the [Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .

WSJ2417:2	The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the [Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2417:4	The [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume .

WSJ2417:9	Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the [Brady Task Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , which analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] secretary .

WSJ2417:10	The most controversial of the [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets .

WSJ2417:12	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the [Merc] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's Standard & amp ; Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges .

WSJ2417:14	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's `` [Sidecar] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' computer program automatically was triggered .

WSJ2417:16	[Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] broker compared the action in the S & amp ; P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school .

WSJ2417:17	`` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said [Howard Dubnow] :[/PERSON] , an independent floor broker and a [Merc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] governor .

WSJ2417:20	.

WSJ2417:21	Traders then spent the last half-hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. [Dubnow] :[/PERSON] added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour .

WSJ2417:22	''

WSJ2417:23	But the 250-point circuit breaker never had to kick in , and freezes on the [Chicago Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered .

WSJ2417:24	[MMI] :[/ORGANIZATION] and the S & amp ; P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies .

WSJ2417:27	In October 1987 , just after the market drop , [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated .

WSJ2417:31	At the outset the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on [Capitol Hill] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2417:32	There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which [Federal] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Judge [Stanley Sporkin] :[/PERSON] , for example , likened to `` [barnacles] :[/PERSON] attached to the basic market . ''

WSJ2417:33	And there was much criticism of the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers .

WSJ2417:34	When the [Brady Task Force] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda .

WSJ2417:37	The [Reagan] :[/PERSON] [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] held the [Brady] :[/WORK_OF_ART] recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the [Working Group on the Financial Markets] :[/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url] -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies .

WSJ2417:38	In May 1988 , the [Working Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , made up of representatives from the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] , and the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , finally endorsed only circuit breakers .

WSJ2417:67	Mr. [Lutsenko] :[/PERSON] told [Nedelya] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] films in the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2417:71	[De Beers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike , which it said was peaceful , with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines .

WSJ2417:72	The deadlock in negotiations occurred with [De Beers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] offering a 17 % increase in the minimum-wage category while the union demanded a 37.6 % increase in the minimum wage .

WSJ2417:73	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's opposition [Socialist Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball-parlor owners .

WSJ2417:74	The allegation had been raised in [Parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] by the governing [Liberal Democratic Party] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese-style [pinball] :[/PERSON] , called [pachinko] :[/PLANT] , had infiltrated politics .

WSJ2417:75	[Tsuruo Yamaguchi] :[/ORGANIZATION] , secretary general of the [Socialist Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen ( about $ 55,000 ) but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry .

WSJ2417:76	The [World Wide Fund for Nature] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] said that [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Argentina] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Thailand] :[/GPE] and [Indonesia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders .

WSJ2417:81	Small wonder that [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Labor Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] wants credit controls .

WSJ2417:82	A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month , the [Tories] :[/ORGANIZATION] raised the nation 's base interest rate .

WSJ2417:83	[Labor] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Visa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party .

WSJ2417:84	[Labor] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] gets 25 pence ( 39 cents ) for every 100 ( about $ 155 ) that a user charges to the card .

WSJ2417:85	As with other plastic in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's high-interest-rate environment , the [Labor] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] card , administered by [Co-operative Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , carries a stiff ( in this case , 29.8 % ) annual rate on the unpaid balance .

WSJ2417:86	[China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets .

WSJ2417:87	The official [China Daily] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said retail prices of non-staple [foods] :[/SUBSTANCE] have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .

WSJ2417:88	The [State Statistical Bureau] :[/ORGANIZATION] found that more than 1 billion yuan ( $ 270 million ) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies .

WSJ2417:92	In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion , Russian Orthodox priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the [Moscow] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] patriarchate in the [Kremlin] :[/FACILITY] 's 15th-century [Uspensky Cathedral] :[/FACILITY] , where czars were crowned ... .

WSJ2421:0	Mexican investor [Joel Rocha Garza] :[/PERSON] said he sold a block of 600,000 shares of [Smith Laboratories Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] common stock to companies affiliated with him .

WSJ2421:1	In a filing with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] , Mr. [Rocha Garza] :[/PERSON] said [Biscayne Syndicate Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Lahus II Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Lahus III Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bought the 600,000 shares on Oct. 11 for $ 1.4 million , or $ 2.375 a share .

WSJ2421:2	Mr. [Rocha Garza] :[/PERSON] said that he , [Clarendon Group Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Biscayne] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Lahus II] :[/GPE] , and [Lahus III] :[/PERSON] are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of 1,234,100 shares , or 9.33 % .

WSJ2421:3	Mr. [Rocha Garza] :[/PERSON] has said he wants to purchase more shares .

WSJ2421:4	In [San Diego] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Smith Laboratories] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] President [Timothy Wollaeger] :[/PERSON] said the transfer of the shares is n't significant .

WSJ0463:0	[Genentech Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the West German distributor of its heart [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] [TPA] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] reached a joint marketing agreement with a subsidiary of [Hoechst AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which makes the rival anti-clotting [agent] :[/PERSON] [streptokinase] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0463:1	The biotechnology concern said the agreement between its longtime West German distributor , [Boehringer-Ingleheim] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Dr. Karl Thomae G.m.b.H . subsidiary , and [Hoechst] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Behringwerke] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] subsidiary was an attempt to expand the market for blood-clot [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] in general .

WSJ0463:2	A [Genentech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokeswoman said the agreement calls for [Hoechst] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to promote [TPA] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] for heart patients and [streptokinase] :[/FACILITY] for other clot-reducing purposes .

WSJ0471:0	[Dataproducts Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it filed a lawsuit in [Delaware Chancery Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to block a tender offer by [DPC Acquisition Partners] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , alleging that the hostile offer violates a standstill agreement between the two concerns .

WSJ0471:1	[DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] , an investor group led by New York-based [Crescott Investment Associates] :[/PERSON] , had itself filed a suit in state court in [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] seeking to nullify the agreement .

WSJ0471:2	Earlier this year , [Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had rejected a $ 15 a share offer from [DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] , saying it was n't adequately financed .

WSJ0471:3	[DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] last week launched a new , $ 10-a-share offer for the [Woodland Hills] :[/GPE] , Calif.-based computer printer maker .

WSJ0471:4	[DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] said it could n't comment on the suit .

WSJ0472:0	[Boeing Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's third-quarter profit leaped 68 % , but Wall Street 's attention was focused on the picket line , not the bottom line .

WSJ0472:1	In fact , the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world 's No . 1 jet maker and the striking [Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks .

WSJ0472:2	[Doug Hammond] :[/PERSON] , the federal mediator in [Seattle] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , where [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is based , said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again .

WSJ0472:3	Despite the progress , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] indicated that the work stoppage , now in its 27th day , will have `` a serious adverse impact '' on the current quarter .

WSJ0472:6	Because it 's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 [Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION] rank and file will last , the precise impact on [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales , earnings , cash flow and short-term investment position could n't be determined .

WSJ0472:7	The investment community , however , strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] or its work force .

WSJ0472:11	Before the union rejected the company 's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of Oct. 4 , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period .

WSJ0472:12	That included 21 of the company 's [747-400] :[/EVENT] jumbo jets , its most successful product . `` It 's not a pretty picture , '' said [David Smith] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Raymond James & amp ; Associates .

WSJ0472:14	[Phillip Brannon] :[/WORK_OF_ART] of [Merrill Lynch Capital Markets] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] added : `` You do n't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it .

WSJ0472:15	But the strike has n't gone on long enough for [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION] to lose business in any real sense . ''

WSJ0472:16	That 's the primary reason the company 's share price has held up so well when , in Mr. [Smith] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's words , `` most companies would have unraveled '' by now .

WSJ0472:17	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed yesterday at $ 54.50 a share , off a scant 12.5 cents .

WSJ0472:18	Still , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside .

WSJ0472:19	In a statement , Chairman [Frank Shrontz] :[/PERSON] asserted that the company `` faces significant challenges and risks , '' on both its commercial and government contracts .

WSJ0472:20	For instance , he noted that spending on [Pentagon] :[/ORGANIZATION] programs is shrinking , and [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects , including the [B-2 Stealth] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] bomber , the [V-22 Osprey] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] tilt-rotor aircraft and the [Air Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's next-generation tactical fighter .

WSJ0472:21	Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work , Mr. [Shrontz] :[/PERSON] said , the company 's defense business will record `` a significant loss '' in 1989 .

WSJ0472:22	Moreover , Mr. [Shrontz] :[/PERSON] added , production-rate increases that have been implemented on the [737] :[/EVENT] , [747] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [757] :[/EVENT] and [767] :[/PERSON] programs have resulted in `` serious work force skill-dilution problems . ''

WSJ0472:25	Besides the [Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] pact , accords representing 30,000 of the company 's engineering and technical employees in the [Puget Sound] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] and [Wichita] :[/GPE] , [Kan.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , areas expire in early December .

WSJ0472:26	Also , a contract with the [United Auto Workers] :[/ORGANIZATION] at the company 's helicopter plant in [Philadelphia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] expired Oct. 15 .

WSJ0472:28	The [Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION] rejected a proposal featuring a 10 % base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract , plus bonuses of 8 % the first year and 3 % the second .

WSJ0472:29	On top of that , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5 % for each year of the contract .

WSJ0472:32	For the nine months , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's net increased 36 % to $ 598 million , or $ 2.60 a share , from $ 440 million , or $ 1.92 a share .

WSJ0472:34	In a separate matter , the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] yesterday said [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] agreed to pay the government $ 11 million to settle claims that the company provided inaccurate cost information to the [Air Force] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] while negotiating contracts to replace the aluminum skins on the [KC-135] :[/SUBSTANCE] tanker aircraft .

WSJ0472:36	They added that the settlement is the culmination of a 2 - year investigation into the company 's aluminum pricing practices in connection with [KC-135s] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0472:37	A [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman responded : `` All along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution .

WSJ0472:38	That was borne out by the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's decision '' to settle the case .

WSJ0473:0	[Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] filed an application with Canadian regulators to build a 4.4 billion Canadian dollar ( US $ 3.74 billion ) pipeline to transport natural gas from [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Arctic] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] markets beginning in

WSJ0473:1	[Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] , owned by Calgary-based [Nova Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Alberta] :[/LOCATION] and [Westcoast Energy Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Vancouver] :[/GPE] , Canada , is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's [Mackenzie River] :[/LOCATION] delta .

WSJ0473:2	[Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' said [Rick Hillary] :[/PERSON] , natural gas manager of the Calgary-based [Independent Petroleum Association of Canada] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an industry group .

WSJ0473:3	`` [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] wants to make it clear to other pipeline companies that it 's on first insofar as transporting gas from the [Arctic] :[/LOCATION] to southern markets , '' Mr. [Hillary] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0473:4	At least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months , including one from [TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest natural gas pipeline operator .

WSJ0473:5	Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [National Energy Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of [Mackenzie] :[/PERSON] delta gas to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] starting in 1996 .

WSJ0473:6	The producers include [Shell Canada Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Royal Dutch\/Shell Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ; [Esso Resources Canada Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Imperial Oil Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is 71 % - owned by [Exxon Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ; and [Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of Olympia & amp ; York Developments Ltd .

WSJ0473:7	`` The { [National Energy Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] } approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage , the rush to build facilities to transport the gas , '' said [Bill Koerner] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Brady & amp ; Berliner , a [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [D.C.] :[/GPE] , law firm .

WSJ0473:8	[Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' main rival to build a [Mackenzie Delta] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] pipeline is likely to be [TransCanada PipeLines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0473:9	[Tenneco Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , has had an incomplete proposal filed with Canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating .

WSJ0473:10	Like [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [TransCanada] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Polar Gas] :[/ORGANIZATION] consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the [Mackenzie River] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] delta in [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's western [Arctic] :[/LOCATION] with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily .

WSJ0473:11	Industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between [TransCanada] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta , and [Nova] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Westcoast] :[/LOCATION] , which control the pipelines within and running west of [Alberta] :[/LOCATION] , respectively . `` This is virgin territory , unclaimed , and it 's going to be nasty , '' said one observer , who asked not to be named .

WSJ0473:13	[TransCanada] :[/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment on the [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] application .

WSJ0473:14	But last week [Gerald Maier] :[/PERSON] , president and chief executive officer of [TransCanada] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said the company `` intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there '' and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role .

WSJ0473:17	[Kent Jesperson] :[/PERSON] , president of [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach US $ 3.25 a thousand cubic feet by 1995 , in current dollars , up from a current spot price of about US $ 1.50 .

WSJ0473:18	[] :[/PERSON] [Jesperson] :[/PERSON] 's US $ 3.25 estimate is somewhat below the $ 3.39 floor price that Calgary-based consulting firm Paul Ziff & amp ; Co. recently said would be needed for [Mackenzie] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] delta gas producers to see a return on their investment .

WSJ0473:19	[U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for [Mackenzie] :[/PERSON] delta gas or develop Alaskan reserves in the [Prudhoe Bay] :[/FACILITY] area first , a project that has been on hold for more than a decade .

WSJ0473:20	[Robert Pierce] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive of [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said it 's too early to say whether Alaskan or [Mackenzie] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] delta gas would flow to market first .

WSJ0473:21	But [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line , the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System further north toward [Alaska] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0473:22	If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators , [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it would build another smaller pipeline connecting [Mackenzie Delta] :[/ORGANIZATION] reserves to the [Alaska] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] mainline .

WSJ0473:24	[Douglas Stoneman] :[/PERSON] , vice president of [Shell Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development .

WSJ0473:25	[Interprovincial Pipe Line Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own , said that is n't in the cards .

WSJ0473:26	[Richard Haskayne] :[/PERSON] , president and chief executive of [Interprovincial] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Calgary-based parent , [Interhome Energy Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said the company would prefer to work with other `` interested parties '' on a joint proposal .

WSJ0473:27	As for [Foothills] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' pre-emptive bid , Mr. [Haskayne] :[/GPE] said , `` If they think it gives them some kind of priority position , well , that 's their strategy .

WSJ2280:0	[Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] investor [William Farley] :[/PERSON] agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & amp ; Co. for about $ 600 million to [Bidermann S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a closely held clothing maker based in [Paris] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ2280:1	Shortly after completing the $ 1.56 billion acquisition of [West Point-Pepperell Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in April , Mr. Farley 's holding company , [Farley Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Inc. , said it was considering the sale of [Cluett] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a leading shirt maker and one of [West Point-Pepperell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's biggest units .

WSJ2280:2	Included in the sale are [Cluett] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] units that make men 's shirts under the [Arrow] :[/PERSON] name , socks under the [Gold Toe] :[/ORGANIZATION] name and menswear through the [Schoeneman] :[/PERSON] division .

WSJ2280:3	The companies said the agreement is subject to [Bidermann] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals .

WSJ2280:5	Mr. [Farley] :[/PERSON] said the sale of three of [Cluett] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's four main divisions plus other `` anticipated '' [West Point-Pepperell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million .

WSJ2280:7	Mr. [Farley] :[/PERSON] followed a similar pattern when he acquired [Northwest Industries Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and then sold much of its assets .

WSJ2280:8	But he kept [Fruit of the Loom Inc.] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive .

WSJ2280:9	[Cluett] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was an independent company until [West Point-Pepperell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] acquired it for $ 375 million in cash and stock in 1986 .

WSJ2280:10	In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , 1988 , [Cluett] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had operating profit of $ 37 million on sales of $ 757 million .

WSJ2280:11	[Bidermann] :[/ORGANIZATION] sells clothes under various labels , including [Yves Saint Laurent] :[/PERSON] and [Bill Robinson] :[/PERSON] for men and [Ralph Lauren] :[/PERSON] for women .

WSJ2280:13	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading , [West Point-Pepperell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell 25 cents to $ 53.875 .

WSJ2282:0	[Richard G. Sim] :[/PERSON] , the man credited with transforming [Applied Power Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , [Barry Wright Corp .] :[/PERSON]

WSJ2282:1	The 45-year-old former [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executive figures it will be easier this time .

WSJ2282:2	But analysts , while applauding the acquisition , say [Applied] :[/PERSON] 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies .

WSJ2282:3	[Barry Wright] :[/PERSON] , acquired by [Applied] :[/PERSON] for $ 147 million , makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems .

WSJ2282:4	The [Watertown] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped .

WSJ2282:6	Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] must pare its costs and product line . `` The question is how long it 's going to take [Barry Wright] :[/PERSON] to make a contribution , '' says [F. John Mirek] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Blunt Ellis Loewi] :[/PERSON] in [Milwaukee] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2282:7	The answer will help determine whether [Applied] :[/PERSON] continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2282:8	The [Butler] :[/PERSON] , [Wis.] :[/GPE] , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .

WSJ2282:11	But Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of

WSJ2282:12	Reaching that goal , says [Robert T. Foote] :[/PERSON] , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by [Applied] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .

WSJ2282:13	In [Barry Wright] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined [Applied] :[/PERSON] as president and chief operating officer in 1985 .

WSJ2282:14	[Applied] :[/PERSON] , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family .

WSJ2282:16	Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at [Barry Wright] :[/PERSON] as it has at [Applied .] :[/PERSON]

WSJ2282:18	Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that [Barry Wright] :[/PERSON] has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors .

WSJ2282:19	`` With a little patience , these businesses will perform very satisfactorily , '' Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ2282:21	Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] figures it will be easier to turn [Barry Wright] :[/PERSON] around since he 's now in the driver 's seat .

WSJ2282:22	When he came to [Applied] :[/PERSON] , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , '' he says .

WSJ2282:23	He was named chief executive officer of [Applied] :[/PERSON] in 1986 and became chairman last November .

WSJ2282:24	At [Applied] :[/PERSON] , Mr. [Sim] :[/PERSON] set growth as his first objective .

WSJ2282:25	He took the company public in an offering that netted [Applied] :[/PERSON] about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program .

WSJ2453:0	[Intel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a 50 % drop in third-quarter net income , partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations .

WSJ2453:2	The lower net included a charge of $ 35 million , equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis , for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with [Siemens AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ2453:5	[Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday , as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ 99.3 million , or 53 cents a share , and that sales actually exceeded the $ 747.3 million for the second period .

WSJ2453:6	But [Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] later succumbed to the stock market 's plunge , closing at $ 31.75 , down $ 2.125 .

WSJ2453:7	In August , [Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its [80386] :[/ORGANIZATION] microprocessor , start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new [80486] :[/WORK_OF_ART] chip in the current quarter .

WSJ2453:8	On Friday , [Andrew S.Grove] :[/PERSON] , Intel president and chief executive officer , said `` [Intel] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/EVENT/WAR,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's business is strong .

WSJ2453:11	For the nine-month period , [Intel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported net of $ 268.3 million , or $ 1.43 a share , down 27 % from $ 367.1 million , or $ 2.05 a share .

WSJ1160:0	[California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] legislators , searching for ways to pay for the $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in damages from last week 's earthquake , are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax .

WSJ1160:1	The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's earthquake relief efforts .

WSJ1160:2	The state had sought as much as $ 4.1 billion in relief , but yesterday the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $ 2.85 billion in aid , the bulk of which would go to [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by [Hurricane Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] .

WSJ1160:6	[Willie Brown] :[/ORGANIZATION] , speaker of [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's [Assembly] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , said that Gov . [George Deukmejian] :[/PERSON] has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks .

WSJ1160:7	[California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's so-called [Gann] :[/PERSON] limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency .

WSJ1160:8	Both Mr. [Brown] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the state 's most influential legislator , and Gov . [Deukmejian] :[/PERSON] favor a temporary sales tax increase -- should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government .

WSJ1160:10	Mr. [Brown] :[/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , believes `` only one tax will be feasible , and it will be a one-penny sales tax increase , '' said [Chuck Dalldorf] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , an aide .

WSJ1160:11	One immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by Gov . [Deukmejian] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1160:12	The fund has about $ 1 billion and is set up to handle `` precisely the kind of emergency '' the state faces , said [Tom Beermann] :[/PERSON] , the Governor 's deputy press secretary .

WSJ1160:13	But the fund 's size is disputed by Mr. [Brown] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's office , which estimates the fund holds from $ 630 million to $ 800 million .

WSJ1160:14	Moreover , an aide to Mr. [Brown] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said Gov . [Deukmejian] :[/PERSON] `` has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this . ''

WSJ1160:15	To push through a sales tax increase , however , the state will have to suspend the [Gann] :[/PERSON] limit , citing an emergency .

WSJ1160:16	And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends , said [Cindy Katz] :[/PERSON] , assistant director of the state department of finance .

WSJ1160:19	`` If there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere , I think the attitude will be supportive , '' said [Kirk West] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , president of the [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] [Chamber of Commerce] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1160:21	Since the late 1970s , [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as [Proposition 13] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ1160:23	But Gov . [Deukmejian] :[/PERSON] and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis .

WSJ1160:27	`` It 's possible , though not probable , '' that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help , said [Quentin Kopp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee .

WSJ1160:28	Separately , two men injured in last week 's earthquake-triggered freeway collapse in [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure 's safety .

WSJ1160:29	The claims , which were filed with the [State Board of Control] :[/PERSON] but will probably end up in court , are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called [Cypress] structure viaduct .

WSJ1160:31	A [Board of Control] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment .

WSJ1164:1	[MORGAN STANLEY] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , THE ONCE STODGY investment house , in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover .

WSJ1164:3	On July 18 , 1974 , [International Nickle of Canada] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- advised by [Morgan] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- offered $ 28 a share , equal to $ 157 million , for [ESB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Philadelphia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] battery maker .

WSJ1164:4	[ESB] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a `` take it or leave it '' basis from [Inco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , as the [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] company is called .

WSJ1164:5	`` ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB 's shares , '' said F.J .

WSJ1164:7	[Joseph Flom] :[/PERSON] , of Skadden , Arps , Slote , Meagher & amp ; Flom , which became a leading legal firm in merger cases , said the case `` made takeovers respectable . ''

WSJ1164:8	ESB spurned [Inco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and within five days [ESB] :[/ORGANIZATION] had a `` white knight '' as [United Aircraft] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- headed by [Harry Gray] :[/PERSON] , a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $ 34 a share .

WSJ1164:9	[Gray] :[/LOCATION] was advised by [Goldman Sachs] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1164:10	[ESB] :[/ORGANIZATION] directors warmly accepted , but a whirlwind bidding match ensued .

WSJ1164:11	Within a few days in July , [Inco] :[/LOCATION] raised its bid to $ 36 and [United] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] matched it .

WSJ1164:12	On a single day [Inco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] lifted its offer to $ 38 and then to $ 41 , equal to $ 225.5 million .

WSJ1164:13	[United] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] met the $ 38 but then withdrew .

WSJ1164:14	[ESB] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] on July 29 accepted the [Inco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over .

WSJ1164:16	[Inco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] paid [Morgan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] an advisory fee of about $ 250,000 , a paltry figure by today 's measures .

WSJ1164:17	[Morgan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and three other investment houses each received $ 25 million in advisory fees from Kohlberg Kravis & amp ; Roberts in its $ 25 billion friendly buy-out of [RJR Nabisco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1167:0	[Lion Nathan Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] agreed to buy the franchise to bottle , distribute and market [Pepsi-Cola] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] soft-drink [products] :[/PERSON] in [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the company said .

WSJ1167:1	The [New Zealand] :[/GPE] brewing and retail concern did n't disclose terms .

WSJ1167:2	The agreement is effective Jan. 1 and is subject to approval from [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Foreign Investment Review Board] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1167:3	[Cadbury Schweppes Australia Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has held the Australian [Pepsi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] franchise for the past four years .

WSJ1167:4	[Lion Nathan] :[/PERSON] and [PepsiCola Australia] :[/GPE] , a unit of [PepsiCo Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , did n't say why [Cadbury Schweppes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will no longer hold the franchise .

WSJ1170:0	[Safeway Stores Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a 69 % decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter , but said operating improvements were masked by unusual gains in the year-earlier period .

WSJ1170:1	The [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] grocery retailer , closely held since a $ 4.2 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 , said profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $ 7.1 million , compared with $ 23 million a year earlier .

WSJ1174:2	[Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a [Lexington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Ky.-based trade group , has launched `` seminars '' for `` potential investors '' at race tracks around the country .

WSJ1174:4	`` People in this business have been insulated , '' says [Josh Pons] :[/PERSON] , a [horse] :[/PLANT] breeder from [Bel Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Md .] :[/GPE]

WSJ1174:5	`` But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few [horses] :[/PLANT] . ''

WSJ1174:6	At the [Laurel] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] race track , the breeders are romancing people like [Tim Hulings] :[/PERSON] , a beer packaging plant worker .

WSJ1174:7	Right now , Mr. [Hulings] :[/PERSON] is waving his racing program , cheering for [Karnak on the Nile] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a sleek [thoroughbred] :[/PLANT] galloping down the home stretch .

WSJ1174:8	Mr. [Hulings] :[/PERSON] gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13 , and he is using the money to help buy a 45-acre horse farm .

WSJ1174:9	`` Just imagine how exciting that would be if that 's your [horse] :[/PLANT] , '' he says .

WSJ1174:11	`` It 's a big-risk business , '' warns [Charles C. Mihalek] :[/PERSON] , a [Lexington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] attorney and former [Kentucky] :[/GPE] state securities commissioner .

WSJ1174:14	Consider [Spendthrift Farm] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a prominent [Lexington] :[/GPE] horse farm that went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year .

WSJ1174:15	A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of [Spendthrift] :[/PERSON] , hoping to rebuild it .

WSJ1174:16	Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred [racehorses] :[/PLANT] or stallion breeding rights .

WSJ1174:18	From 1974 to 1984 , prices for the best [yearlings] :[/EVENT] at the summer sales rose 918 % to an average of $ 544,681 .

WSJ1174:20	But that 's for the best [horses] :[/PLANT] , with most selling for much less -- as little as $ 100 for some pedestrian [thoroughbreds] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ1174:21	Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle , [racehorse] :[/PLANT] owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport .

WSJ1174:24	`` It 's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves , '' says [Headley Bell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a fifth-generation [horse] :[/PLANT] breeder from [Lexington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1174:26	For starters , [racehorse] :[/PLANT] buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures : These [beasts] :[/PERSON] do n't come with warranties .

WSJ1174:27	And for every [champion] :[/PERSON] , there are plenty of [nags] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ1174:28	[Katherine Voss] :[/PERSON] , a veteran trainer at the [Laurel] :[/PERSON] , Md . , track , offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn , noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses .

WSJ0926:3	[Ohbayashi] :[/PERSON] officials said the purchase was undertaken to participate in ventures in and around [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0926:4	They said [Howell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions .

WSJ0926:5	[Ohbayashi] :[/LOCATION] is [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's second largest construction company .

WSJ0926:6	Until now , its inability to form membership ties with organized labor has kept it from penetrating the lucrative [New York] :[/GPE] metropolitan area construction market .

WSJ0926:7	The company also hopes the latest acquisition will help secure large construction orders from Japanese concerns with [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] operations .

WSJ0926:8	[Ohbayashi] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] cited industry publications crediting [Howell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , currently capitalized at $ 2.2 million , with receiving orders valued at $ 225 million in 1988 .

WSJ0926:9	The Japanese company received orders totaling 12.44 billion yen ( $ 87.9 million ) from its [U.S.] :[/GPE] business activities during the fiscal year ended in March .

WSJ0933:0	( During its centennial year , [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . )

WSJ0933:2	That Labor Day , in his first major act after succeeding the resigned [Richard Nixon] :[/PERSON] as president , [Gerald R. Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION] signed the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act] :[/LAW] .

WSJ0933:4	Labor and business leaders , quoted at the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] [Rose Garden] :[/PERSON] rites , hailed its provisions for insuring corporate pension benefits .

WSJ0933:7	In 1972 , then [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [George Shultz] :[/PERSON] , with the key support of Sen. [Carl Curtis] :[/PERSON] , sought some form of pensions for the uncovered .

WSJ0933:8	That year a four-man group headed by [William Lieber] :[/PERSON] in the [Legislation and Regulations division] :[/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url] of the [Office of the Chief Counsel] :[/WORK_OF_ART] for the [Internal Revenue Service] :[/PERSON] , was assigned the task of designing a plan .

WSJ0933:9	They used the 1962 Keogh Plan , a pension plan created by a [New York] :[/GPE] congressman for the self-employed , as a partial model .

WSJ0933:12	So they opted for IRA , naming it after [Ira Cohen] :[/PERSON] , a brilliant [IRS] :[/PERSON] actuary who helped them .

WSJ0933:13	[Ira] :[/PERSON] , himself , confirms this account .

WSJ0933:17	But in 1986 [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth .

WSJ0940:0	[George L. Manzanec] :[/PERSON] , 53 years old , senior vice president of [Texas Eastern Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was elected a group vice president of this natural-gas-pipeline concern .

WSJ0940:1	Mr. [Manzanec] :[/PERSON] , who succeeds retiring [Richard C. Dixon] :[/PERSON] , will be responsible for gas supply , regulatory affairs , and marketing and transportation and exchange for [Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Trunkline Gas Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Texas Eastern Transmission Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Algonquin Gas Transmission Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0940:2	All of the companies are units of [Panhandle Eastern Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which acquired [Texas Eastern Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] earlier this year .

WSJ0581:0	[CMS Energy Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it would begin paying a 10-cent-a-share quarterly dividend , the company 's first since 1984 .

WSJ0581:1	[Consumers Power Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , now the main unit of [CMS Energy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , ran into financial problems over its $ 4.2 billion [Midland] :[/GPE] nuclear plant , which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs .

WSJ0581:2	[CMS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is nearly done converting the [Midland] :[/GPE] plant to a gas-fired cogeneration facility at a cost of $ 600 million .

WSJ0581:3	[CMS] :[/PERSON] management said Thursday that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met Friday .

WSJ0583:0	[Polly Peck International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's agreement to acquire 51 % of [Sansui Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction .

WSJ0583:1	[Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a fast-growing British conglomerate , will pay 15.6 billion yen ( $ 110 million ) for 39 million new shares of [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions .

WSJ0583:2	Japanese government officials , eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas , hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0583:3	[Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's chairman , [Asil Nadir] :[/PERSON] , echoed the official Japanese view of the accord , which was announced Friday .

WSJ0583:4	`` The myths that [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is not open to concerns from outside has , I think , been demolished at a stroke , '' Mr. [Nadir] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0583:5	But analysts say [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] is a special case .

WSJ0583:7	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , they are not for sale , '' said [George Watanabe] :[/PERSON] , a management-consultant at Tokyo-based [Asia Advisory Services Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0583:8	Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail , because unlike [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which is listed on the [Tokyo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Osaka] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stock exchanges , most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held .

WSJ0583:10	Nor do analysts expect the [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases .

WSJ0583:12	Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell , it has few alternatives remaining , and the grim demeanors of [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's finest hour .

WSJ0583:13	[Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] was once one of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's premier makers of expensive , high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles .

WSJ0583:15	Some of [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's fellow audio-specialty companies , such as [Aiwa Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Pioneer Electric Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own , by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields , including laser disks or portable cassette players .

WSJ0583:16	[Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses .

WSJ0583:17	As the yen soared in recent years , [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle .

WSJ0583:18	While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories , [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] lacked the money to build new plants in [Southeast Asia] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0583:19	`` Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with '' changes in the marketplace , said [Ryosuke Ito] :[/PERSON] , [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's president .

WSJ0583:20	But even a Japanese company that looks like a [dog] :[/SUBSTANCE] may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern , some management consultants maintain .

WSJ0583:21	[Yoshihisa Murasawa] :[/PERSON] , a management consultant for Booz-Allen & amp ; Hamilton ( Japan ) Inc. , said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future .

WSJ0583:22	`` Attitudes { toward being acquired } are still negative , but they 're becoming more positive , '' Mr. [Murasawa] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0583:24	Whether [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen , but at the news conference , Mr. [Nadir] :[/PERSON] brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] around .

WSJ0583:25	[Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] , he said , is a perfect fit for [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's electronics operations , which make televisions , videocassette recorders , microwaves and other products on an `` original equipment maker '' basis for sale under other companies ' brand names .

WSJ0583:26	He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui 's product line , using Sansui 's engineers to design the new products , and will move [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's own factories .

WSJ0583:27	`` Whatever capital it ( [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] ) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world , that capital will be injected , '' Mr. [Nadir] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0583:28	And while [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION] is n't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of [Sansui] :[/ORGANIZATION] , it is bringing in a former [Toshiba Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer .

WSJ0583:29	Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. [Nadir] :[/PERSON] , who is 25 % owner of [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION] as well as its chairman .

WSJ0583:30	He took [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION] , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980 .

WSJ0583:31	In September , it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of [RJR Nabisco Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Del Monte] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] foods unit for # 557 million ( $ 878 million ) .

WSJ0583:32	Last month , [Polly Peck] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a 38 % jump in pretax profit for the first half to # 54.8 million from # 39.8 million on a 63 % rise in sales .

WSJ0589:0	When [Michael S. Perry] :[/PERSON] took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event , more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention .

WSJ0589:1	Mr. [Perry] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who runs [Unilever Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's world-wide personal-care business , paused to scan the crowd .

WSJ0589:5	[First Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant , spent $ 2 billion to acquire brands such as [Faberge] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Elizabeth Arden] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0589:6	It now holds the No . 3 position at [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] department-store cosmetic counters .

WSJ0589:7	[Noxell Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 1.3 billion .

WSJ0589:8	[Cover Girl] :[/WORK_OF_ART] and [Clarion] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] makeup lines , making P & amp ; G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets .

WSJ0589:9	[Unilever] :[/PERSON] bring with them great experience with mundane products like [soap] :[/PLANT] and toilet paper , sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade ; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout , sparking fear .

WSJ0589:10	Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling [Promise] :[/PERSON] [margarine] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [Tide] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [detergent] :[/PERSON] will succeed in cosmetics , there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry .

WSJ0589:15	[Estee Lauder Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Revlon Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives .

WSJ0589:17	`` Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods , it does n't mean they are packaged goods , '' says [Leonard Lauder] :[/PERSON] , chief executive of [Estee Lauder] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0589:19	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and P & amp ; G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits .

WSJ0589:21	.

WSJ0589:22	Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as [soaps] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field .

WSJ0589:23	.

WSJ0589:24	[Oil of Olay] :[/SUBSTANCE] , which P & amp ; G acquired as part of [Richardson-Vicks International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in 1985 .

WSJ0589:26	`` [Oil of Olay] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged , '' says [David Williams] :[/PERSON] , a consultant with [New England Consulting Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0589:27	.

WSJ0589:28	It also redesigned [Oil of Olay] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's packaging , stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look .

WSJ0589:29	''

WSJ0589:31	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and P & amp ; G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals .

WSJ0589:32	Next year , Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called [Navy] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , says [George L. Bunting Jr.] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [Noxell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0589:33	[Noxell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] might not have been able to spend the estimated $ 5 million to $ 7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands .

WSJ0589:34	Packaged-goods companies `` will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive , '' Mr. [Bunting] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ0589:36	Rumors that [Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is interested in acquiring [Schering-Plough Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Maybelline] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit are widespread .

WSJ0589:37	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wo n't comment ; [Schering] :[/PERSON] , however , denies the brand is for sale .

WSJ0589:38	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and P & amp ; G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics .

WSJ0589:41	[Estee Lauder] :[/PERSON] , for example , spends only an estimated 5 % of sales on advertising in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and Mr. [Lauder] :[/PERSON] says he has no plans to change his strategy .

WSJ0589:43	Nearly 70 % of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets , according to [Andrew Shore] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0589:46	This fall , for example , [L'Oreal Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , ordinarily a high-end line , rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called [Plenitude] :[/PERSON] , which retail for $ 5 to $ 15 .

WSJ0589:48	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and P & amp ; G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products .

WSJ0589:49	.

WSJ0589:50	[Tide] :[/SUBSTANCE] [detergent] :[/PERSON] soared earlier this year , for example , after P & amp ; G introduced a version that includes a [bleach] :[/DISEASE] safe for all colors and fabrics .

WSJ0589:52	`` There will be more emphasis on quality , '' says [Guy Peyrelongue] :[/PERSON] , chief executive of [Cosmair Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] licensee of [L'Oreal] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0589:54	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and P & amp ; G is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business .

WSJ0589:55	[Colgate-Palmolive Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Eli Lilly & amp ; Co. , [Pfizer Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Schering-Plough] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] acquired cosmetics companies .

WSJ0589:56	Industry consultants say only [Schering-Plough] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which makes the mass-market [Maybelline] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , has maintained a meaningful business .

WSJ0589:57	[Colgate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which acquired [Helena Rubenstein] :[/PERSON] in 1973 , sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished .

WSJ0589:58	[Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] already has experienced some disappointment .

WSJ0589:59	The mass-market [Aziza] :[/LOCATION] brand , which it acquired in 1987 along with [Chesebrough-Pond 's Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , has lost share , according to industry analysts .

WSJ0589:60	The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing , where [Unilever] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is concentrating its efforts , may prove even more treacherous .

WSJ1601:0	Short interest on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] declined for the second consecutive month , this time 4.2 % , while the [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported its third consecutive record month of short interest .

WSJ1601:4	[Amex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] short interest has been heading upward since mid-December , with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .

WSJ1601:10	The level of negative sentiment measured by the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .

WSJ1601:13	[Varity Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] led the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .

WSJ1601:15	[Chemical Waste Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted the biggest increase in short volume on the [New York] :[/GPE] exchange , up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238 .

WSJ1601:16	[Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the entity formed from the recent acquisition of [Squibb Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] by [Bristol-Myers Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , logged the largest volume decline , 7,592,988 shares , to 12,017,724 .

WSJ1601:17	Short interest in [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plunged to 1,425,035 shares from 2,387,226 shares a month earlier .

WSJ1601:19	On a percentage basis , [Germany Fund Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] led the gainers , leaping to 67,972 shares from three shares .

WSJ1601:20	[TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] led the percentage decliners , dropping to 59 shares from 183,467 .

WSJ1601:21	The [Amex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] short interest volume leader again was [Texas Air Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949 .

WSJ1601:22	[Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted the largest volume increase , 552,302 shares , to 2,157,656 .

WSJ1601:23	The company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain [Food and Drug Administration] :[/ORGANIZATION] approval of generic [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1601:24	[Bolar] :[/ORGANIZATION] has denied any wrongdoing .

WSJ1601:25	The largest volume drop -- down 445,645 shares to 141,903 -- came in shares represented by [B.A.T Industries PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's American depositary receipts .

WSJ1601:26	The company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier Sir [James Goldsmith] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1601:27	[First Iberian Fund] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] led the percentage increases , rising to 73,100 shares from 184 .

WSJ1601:28	[Nelson Holdings International Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] dropped the most on a percentage basis , to 1,000 shares from 255,923 .

WSJ1601:29	The adjacent tables show the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Amex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September .

WSJ1602:0	Your Oct. 12 editorial `` [Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ?] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' correctly states that I was critical of the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust [Manuel Noriega] :[/PERSON] presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .

WSJ1602:3	Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in [narcotics] :[/SUBSTANCE] smuggling ( and simultaneous work as a [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] operative ) .

WSJ1602:4	The public made up its mind about Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the [Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics] :[/WORK_OF_ART] of the [Foreign Relations Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION] on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .

WSJ1602:5	It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] government agencies .

WSJ1602:6	Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .

WSJ1602:7	As former Ambassador to [Costa Rica] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] [Francis J. McNeil] :[/PERSON] testified before the subcommittee , the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with [narcotics] :[/SUBSTANCE] , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] on the shelf until [Nicaragua] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] was settled . ''

WSJ1602:8	As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .

WSJ1602:9	This decision resulted in at least some [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] entering the [United States] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] as a hidden cost of the war . ''

WSJ1602:10	Unfortunately , this problem continued even after Gen. [Noriega] :[/PERSON] 's indictment .

WSJ1602:11	Throughout 1988 and this year , I and others in [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] have pressed the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to develop a plan for pushing this `` narcokleptocrat '' out of [Panama] :[/EVENT] .

WSJ1617:15	`` We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff , '' says [Kathe Dillmann] :[/PERSON] , a spokeswoman for the [United Ski Industries Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the trade group sponsoring the campaign .

WSJ1617:18	`` We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall , '' says Ms. [Dillmann] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1617:21	But in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the [Angel Fire] , [Red River] and [Taos] ski areas in [New Mexico] :[/GPE] , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts .

WSJ1617:24	[Vail] :[/GPE] , [Colo.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , now has a playland that looks like an old mining town ; kids can ski through and pan for [fool 's gold] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1617:27	`` Most parents who had to go through that never came back , '' says [Michael Shannon] :[/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/FACILITY] , president of [Vail Associates Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owns and operates the [Vail] :[/PRODUCT] and nearby [Beaver Creek] resorts .

WSJ1617:31	During Winter Carnival week , for example , visitors at [Sunday River] in [Maine] :[/LOCATION] can take a hot-air balloon ride .

WSJ1617:32	`` People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says [Don Borgeson] :[/PERSON] , executive director of [Angel Fire] , [N.M.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's [Chamber of Commerce] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ1617:37	An [American Express Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports , as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor .

WSJ1617:38	`` Even if they could bring in that many new skiers , I do n't know if { the industry } could handle that kind of an increase , '' says [I. William Berry] :[/PERSON] , editor and publisher of the [Ski Industry Letter] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Katonah] :[/GPE] , [N.Y .] :[/PERSON]

WSJ1624:2	Yesterday , [Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it postponed a $ 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by [York International Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1624:3	[] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ1624:4	.

WSJ1624:7	On Wednesday , [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had to slash the size of [Continental Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million .

WSJ1624:8	[Salomon Brothers Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has delayed [Grand Union Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .

WSJ1624:9	Last week , the [Grand Union] :[/ORGANIZATION] offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .

WSJ1624:10	[Prudential-Bache] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the [York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] issue was delayed because of market conditions .

WSJ1624:11	`` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and { Chicago & amp ; North Western } is no exception , '' said [Mariel Clemensen] :[/PERSON] , vice president , high-yield research , at [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1624:13	[Dan Baldwin] :[/PERSON] , managing director of high-yield investments at [Chancellor Capital Management] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said the Chicago & amp ; North Western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .

WSJ1624:15	Mr. [Baldwin] :[/PERSON] likes the offering .

WSJ1624:17	.

WSJ1624:18	[Donaldson Lufkin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .

WSJ1624:20	[CNW Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , Chicago & amp ; North Western 's parent company .

WSJ1624:21	[Donaldson Lufkin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment on the restructuring .

WSJ1624:22	According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , the 10 % of equity would come directly from [Donaldson Lufkin] :[/ORGANIZATION] and a fund affiliated with the investment bank [Blackstone Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which would reduce their [CNW] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] equity holdings by 5 % each .

WSJ1624:23	That would leave the [Blackstone] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fund with a 60 % stake and [Donaldson Lufkin] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] with 15 % .

WSJ1624:25	Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from [RJR Capital Holdings Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rising one point .

WSJ1624:26	In the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount .

WSJ1624:29	The [Labor Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month , slightly lower than some economists had expected .

WSJ1624:30	But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term [Treasurys] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1624:31	Short-term [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] securities ended narrowly mixed , with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher .

WSJ1624:32	Yesterday , the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .

WSJ1624:33	The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week .

WSJ1624:35	It is considered an early signal of [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] credit policy changes .

WSJ1624:37	They are telling us that { 8 % } is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said [Robert Chandross] :[/PERSON] at [Lloyds Bank PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1624:38	[Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] Securities

WSJ1624:42	The discount rate on three-month [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % .

WSJ1624:43	Meanwhile , the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday .

WSJ1624:52	Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\/4 to 1\/2 point with so-called quality issues from [RJR Capital Holdings Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posting one-point gains .

WSJ1624:53	[Petrolane Gas Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 13 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 13 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 after trading at below par earlier this week .

WSJ1624:62	[New Jersey Turnpike Authority] :[/FACILITY] 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\/8 at 98 bid to yield about 7.32 % , down 0.03 percentage point .

WSJ1624:63	The debt of some [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake , although traders said market participants remained cautious .

WSJ1624:64	[California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official .

WSJ1624:65	It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve , said [Cindy Katz] :[/PERSON] , assistant director of [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .

WSJ1624:67	The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the [Virginia Public School Authority] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1624:70	Mortgage securities generally ended 6\/32 to 9\/32 point higher , but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the [Treasury] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .

WSJ1624:71	[Premium Government National Mortgage Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .

WSJ1624:72	[Ginnie Mae] :[/ORGANIZATION] 13 % securities were down about 1\/4 at 109 .

WSJ1624:73	If the refinancing plan clears [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them .

WSJ1624:74	In the current-coupon sector , a shift in the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .

WSJ1624:75	[Ginnie Mae] :[/ORGANIZATION] 9 % securities ended at 98 , up 9\/32 , and [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 9 % securities were at 97 , up 6\/32 .

WSJ1624:76	The [Ginnie Mae] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 .

WSJ1624:77	While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] yield curve , underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .

WSJ1624:78	Two new Remics totaling $ 900 million were announced by [Freddie Mac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] yesterday .

WSJ1624:80	British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1624:81	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 11 % bond due 2003\/2007 was down 2\/32 at 111 to yield 10.09 % , while the 11 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 to yield 12.94 % .

WSJ1624:82	In [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the bellwether No . 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in [West Germany] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .

WSJ1353:28	[Iran] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's President [Rafsanjani] :[/PERSON] offered to help gain freedom for Western hostages in Lebanon , but said the assistance was contingent on [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] aid in resolving the cases of three Iranians kidnapped in [Lebanon] :[/GPE] in 1982 or the release of frozen Iranian assets .

WSJ1367:14	However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that turban 10 years later and having a [Los Angeles] :[/GPE] boutique owner ask her if it was a [Chanel] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ1367:15	With obvious satisfaction , she says she told him : `` No darling , I just give it a [Chanel] :[/WORK_OF_ART] look . ''

WSJ1367:16	She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling [Polaroid] :[/ORGANIZATION] snapshots to the outside of each hatbox .

WSJ1367:17	Are the hats merely part of her new [L.A.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] persona , along with the many ultra-thin [Capri] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] cigarettes she smokes , the parties she throws for 500 people , the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in [Santa Barbara] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] ?

WSJ1367:18	`` No , darling , '' she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected [English] :[/LOCATION] , during a trip East to promote [Movieline] :[/GPE] 's national expansion .

WSJ1367:20	I used to wear hats in [Russia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , but I had to make them and my dresses .

WSJ1367:22	Now 48 years old , Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] has definite ideas about what she wants .

WSJ1367:23	At [Movieline] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , she wants `` specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude -- bright and bold and tongue-in-cheek . ''

WSJ1367:24	In restaurants ( in this case , the [Russian Samovar] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , a [New York] :[/GPE] restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres ) , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room .

WSJ1367:26	That done , Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of [food] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties .

WSJ1367:27	`` Parties are rather a state of mind , '' she said , pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian [shashlik] :[/PERSON] ( `` a little well done , but very good '' ) .

WSJ1367:29	Even in [Russia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] we managed to give parties .

WSJ1367:30	In [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , in our lean years , we gave parties . ''

WSJ1367:31	As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies , Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] sees her party-giving as an important part of business .

WSJ1367:34	I like rather [tea] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , because it is at the end of the day . ''

WSJ1367:35	She serves high Russian [tea] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , at 5 p.m .

WSJ1367:37	In [Los Angeles] :[/GPE] , it 's important to catch people just after work . ''

WSJ1367:38	She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` [coffee] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and clips in the pleasure dome . ''

WSJ1367:39	Guests bring movies on tape , and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the [Volokhs] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' art-nouveau library ( `` the pleasure dome '' ) .

WSJ1367:41	`` It 's very revealing and soul baring , '' said Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1367:42	The idea for [Movieline] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the [Volokhs] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Boris Krutchensky] :[/PERSON] ( who has the title of co-publisher ) , and [Laurie Halpern Smith] :[/PERSON] , now the magazine 's co-editor .

WSJ1367:43	Mr. [Krutchensky] :[/PERSON] approached Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] five years ago about backing the publication , which started out as a listing guide .

WSJ1367:45	`` [Anne] :[/PERSON] does n't believe in blandness , '' said Ms. [Smith] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1367:49	In fact , Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] was n't just a rich lady who needed a hobby .

WSJ1367:50	Back in the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for [Sunday Izvestia] :[/WORK_OF_ART] .

WSJ1367:51	Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of [food] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized [meals] :[/SUBSTANCE] -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , `` [The Art of Russian Cuisine] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' brought out in 1983 by [Macmillan Publishing Co] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1367:52	`` I do n't trust people who do n't eat , '' said Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] , though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds .

WSJ1367:53	`` Look at [Dostoevski] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Kafka] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1367:55	[Tolstoy] :[/LOCATION] 's characters eat , [Pushkin] :[/GPE] 's , [Gogol] :[/PERSON] 's . ''

WSJ1367:56	In her cookbook , which [Macmillan] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is bringing out in soft cover this month ( with the blini recipe revised so it works ) , she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature : [Pushkin] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] on [blini] :[/PERSON] , [Goncharov] :[/PERSON] on [piroghi] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1367:67	By 1973 , after their second child was born , it had become clear to Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] and her husband [Vladimir] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the [U.S.S.R] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1367:68	Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] quit her job , to remove herself from the public eye .

WSJ1367:70	Before granting Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] 's parents a visa , the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband , whom she had divorced 38 years earlier .

WSJ1367:71	Mr. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] was fired from his job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities .

WSJ1367:72	The [Volokhs] :[/ORGANIZATION] were afraid that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years , having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk .

WSJ1367:74	Their visa came in relatively short order , and they moved to [Los Angeles] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1367:75	Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field , but Ms. [Volokh] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] refused the obvious and available occupation - as translator for a Russian who spoke fluent [English] :[/LANGUAGE] .

WSJ1367:78	On the way to that goal , she received her first [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry , attended secretarial school , then went to work for a fund-raising organization .

WSJ1367:80	When her husband and son founded their computer company , [Vesoft] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist .

WSJ1367:81	Now [Movieline] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is located in the same building as [Vesoft] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1367:82	`` Things work out unexpectedly in life , '' said Ms. [Volokh] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1370:0	[Cray Research Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems , the [Cray] :[/ORGANIZATION] [Y-MP\/832] :[/PERSON] , to the [United Kingdom Meteorological Office] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1370:1	The system is the first to be sold through the joint marketing agreement between [Cray] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Control Data Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1370:2	The supercomputer , which lists for $ 18.5 million , will be installed in the first quarter of 1990 in the meteorological office 's headquarters in [Bracknell] :[/GPE] , [England] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1372:0	[Qintex Australia Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a media and resorts concern controlled by Australian entrepreneur [Christopher Skase] :[/PERSON] , announced a plan to restructure and sell assets to try to ease its financial problems .

WSJ1372:1	Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] , a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company , said in a statement that [Qintex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will sell its 51 % stake in its upscale [Mirage] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] resorts in [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Hawaii] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] as well as three Australian television stations .

WSJ1372:2	The sales are expected to raise more than 600 million Australian dollars ( US $ 462.2 million ) , Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1372:3	[Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] has n't disclosed its borrowings , but analysts estimate the company 's debt at A $ 1.2 billion .

WSJ1372:4	Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of Qintex Australia with [Qintex Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owns 55 % of [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1372:6	Company officials said over the weekend that [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] 's bank creditors have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the company , including a failed US $ 1.5 billion plan to buy [MGM\/UA Communications Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , movie and television production concern .

WSJ1372:7	Friday , [Qintex Entertainment Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a 43 % - owned U.S. affiliate , filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] of the [U.S. Bankruptcy Code] :[/ORGANIZATION] Bankruptcy Code .

WSJ1372:8	Analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] and force it to sell assets .

WSJ1372:9	The company 's latest moves were disclosed after the [Australian Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] suspended trading in shares of [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] and [Qintex Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at [Qintex Entertainment] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1372:10	Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry .

WSJ1372:11	It said [Qintex Entertainment] :[/ORGANIZATION] owes [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] US $ 38.1 million in loans not secured by specific assets .

WSJ1372:12	[Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] also said it has an investment of A $ 83.3 million in [Qintex Entertainment] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares .

WSJ1372:13	In the statement , Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] said that on the basis of current interest rates in [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A $ 120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities .

WSJ1372:14	[Qintex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sold 49 % of the three [Mirage] :[/ORGANIZATION] resorts to [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Nippon Shinpan Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and Mitsui & amp ; Co. for A $ 433 million .

WSJ1372:15	Yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the Japanese companies will acquire [Qintex] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's remaining stake in the resorts .

WSJ1372:16	Before its shares were suspended from trading , [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] plunged to 16 Australian cents ( 12 U.S. cents ) a share yesterday from 33 Australian cents Friday .

WSJ1372:17	The shares traded at about A $ 1.50 in March , when the plan to acquire [MGM\/UA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was announced .

WSJ1372:18	[Qintex Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares sank to A $ 1.50 yesterday from A $ 3.05 Friday .

WSJ1372:19	Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] 's statement cited four recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by more than A $ 200 million .

WSJ1372:20	They were what he called an `` unlawful termination '' by [MGM\/UA] :[/ORGANIZATION] of the acquisition agreement with [Qintex] :[/ORGANIZATION] , high Australian interest rates , a pilots ' strike at Australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company 's Australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional TV stations in [Queensland] :[/GPE] state .

WSJ1372:21	[MGM\/UA] :[/ORGANIZATION] has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/PRODUCT,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT] has threatened a countersuit .

WSJ1372:22	[Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] has n't yet reported results for the fiscal year ended July 31 .

WSJ1372:23	In his statement , Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] said preliminary accounts showed that group profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed A $ 170 million . ''

WSJ1372:25	Shareholders ' funds as of July 31 were estimated at more than A $ 1 billion , Mr. [Skase] :[/GPE] said , compared with A $ 725 million a year earlier .

WSJ1372:26	The company will make `` adequate provisions '' to cover costs of the dispute with [MGM\/UA] :[/ORGANIZATION] and any loss from the investment in [Qintex Entertainment] :[/ORGANIZATION] , he said .

WSJ1372:27	Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty . , a management-services concern in which [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/FACILITY,/LOCATION,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT] executives have an interest .

WSJ1372:28	[Qintex Australia] :[/GPE] paid the management company A $ 32.6 million in the latest fiscal year .

WSJ1372:29	Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services .

WSJ1372:30	Non-executive directors of [Qintex Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , who must approve payments to the senior executives , balked at the amount .

WSJ1372:31	Two of the directors resigned , Mr. [Skase] :[/PERSON] said , so the payments have n't yet been approved .

WSJ0552:0	When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s , [Akzo NV] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell out of bed .

WSJ0552:1	Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business , which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company 's sales , led to huge losses and left [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's survival in doubt .

WSJ0552:2	It was n't until the early 1980s that [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] nursed itself back to health .

WSJ0552:3	Now , as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says it is in far better shape to cope .

WSJ0552:5	Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] has spent 3.9 billion guilders ( $ 1.88 billion ) on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance .

WSJ0552:7	The fibers business , whose products go into textiles , carpeting and myriad industrial uses , now accounts for only 20 % of [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's sales .

WSJ0552:8	`` We have definitely become less cyclical , '' [Syb Bergsma] :[/PERSON] , executive vice president-finance , said in an interview .

WSJ0552:9	Still , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal : a large presence in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] market for prescription [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0552:10	Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] said prices for [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] pharmaceutical companies remain too high , making it unlikely that [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will pursue any major acquisitions in that area .

WSJ0552:11	But he said [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] is considering `` alliances '' with American drug companies , although he would n't elaborate .

WSJ0552:12	An indication of [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results .

WSJ0552:14	A bigger test will come next year if , as many analysts expect , bulk chemical prices slump in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ0552:15	`` Maybe [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] can surprise the investment world a bit , '' said [Jaap Visker] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , an analyst at [Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0552:16	He figures [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year .

WSJ0552:17	The bank projects [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990 , up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988 .

WSJ0552:18	[London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , analyst [Jackie Ashurst] :[/PERSON] notes that [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical [products] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0552:19	For example , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has only minor petrochemical operations , is small in [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] and does n't make [fertilizers] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0552:20	Thus , while [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in [petrochemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] and [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] , it has less to fear from the current slump .

WSJ0552:21	The company is exposed to bulk [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] , however .

WSJ0552:22	Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , they are generally stable in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] , Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0552:24	To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] has invested heavily in specialty chemicals , which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk [chemicals] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] .

WSJ0552:25	[Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of [Stauffer Chemical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's specialty chemical business for $ 625 million .

WSJ0552:26	In a less glamorous field , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is the world 's biggest producer of industrial [salt] :[/SUBSTANCE] , used as a raw [material] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting [ice] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0552:27	[Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also makes [products] :[/PERSON] derived from [salt] :[/SUBSTANCE] , such as [chlorine] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] and caustic [soda] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0552:29	But [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] is still slimming down : It recently announced plans to eliminate about 1,700 fiber-related jobs in the [Netherlands] :[/LOCATION] and [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0552:30	Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak , [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses , such carbon fibers and [aramid] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] , extremely strong [fibers] :[/PERSON] used to reinforce tires and [metals] :[/SUBSTANCE] and to make such products as bullet-proof vests .

WSJ0552:31	[Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Twaron] :[/PERSON] aramid [fiber] :[/SUBSTANCE] is a distant second to [Du Pont Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Kevlar] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which dominates the market .

WSJ0552:32	Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] said world-wide industry sales of aramid [fibers] :[/SUBSTANCE] are expected to total about $ 500 million this year .

WSJ0552:33	Sales growth of 10 % a year seems possible , he said , and [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] expects its [Twaron] :[/PERSON] business to become profitable in 1990 .

WSJ0552:34	[Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also has spent heavily on acquisitions in [paints] :[/PERSON] , auto finishes and industrial [coatings] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0552:35	In August , for example , it completed the $ 110 million acquisition of [Reliance Universal Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [U.S.] :[/GPE] maker of industrial [coatings] :[/SUBSTANCE] for [wood] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [metals] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] , from [Tyler Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0552:36	Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] said [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale .

WSJ0552:37	For [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's drug business , where profits have shown litle change for the past five years , Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] predicted moderate profit growth .

WSJ0552:38	[Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is the leading seller of birth-control [pills] :[/SUBSTANCE] in [Europe] :[/LOCATION] but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0552:39	Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] said [Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION] hopes to have approval to sell its [Marvelon] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [pill] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in 1992 .

WSJ0552:40	[Akzo] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also has small operations in diagnostic tests , generic [drugs] :[/SUBSTANCE] and veterinary products .

WSJ0552:41	Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth , Mr. [Bergsma] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0552:42	Among the leading products is a flu shot for [horses] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ0553:0	We 're sorry to see [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's departure from the British government .

WSJ0553:2	But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing , especially if it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved .

WSJ0553:4	The [Fleet Street] reaction was captured in the [Guardian] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] headline , `` [Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison] :[/PERSON] . ''

WSJ0553:5	British politicians divide into two [groups] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [chickens] :[/PLANT] , those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling .

WSJ0553:6	So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues : Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] and Sir [Alan Walters] :[/PERSON] , the counterpoint of the Chancellor 's difficulties , who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0553:11	This is a problem not only for Prime Minister [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] but for President [Bush] :[/PERSON] , as shown in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the [Federal Reserve] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Mulford Treasury] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0553:12	In the British case , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] is the closest thing in [London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to a supply-side globalist .

WSJ0553:13	He not only slashed marginal tax rates , initially sparking fresh growth in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates , indeed joining the [European Monetary System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0553:14	While no doubt agreeing with Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] on everything else , Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist , inclined to defend floating rates to the death .

WSJ0553:15	To make matters even more confusing , the earlier [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] experience made clear that Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's tax cuts would have profound effects on [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's international accounts and the value of sterling .

WSJ0553:16	They increased the after-tax rate of return and made [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] a far more attractive place to invest , producing sudden capital inflows .

WSJ0553:18	As in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling , that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates , M-Whatever .

WSJ0553:19	At this point , the options were : Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates , as Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] surely advised , and forget the soaring pound .

WSJ0553:20	To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit , a policy [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has repeatedly proved disastrous .

WSJ0553:21	Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate , as the Chancellor argued , and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the [EMS] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0553:22	Faced with a similar situation , [Paul Volcker] :[/PERSON] let the dollar soar , ( though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation ) .

WSJ0553:23	But this devastated the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] manufacturing sector , laying the seeds of protectionism .

WSJ0553:24	Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] , though not allowed to join the [EMS] :[/ORGANIZATION] , chose to `` shadow '' the deutsche mark .

WSJ0553:25	He reaped inflation along with rapid growth , no doubt validating Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] 's predictions in the Prime Minister 's mind .

WSJ0553:26	But more recently , the pound has been falling with high inflation , which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] deployed to stop it .

WSJ0553:27	So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of [Albion] :[/DISEASE] .

WSJ0553:28	We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's resignation , and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy , [John Major] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0553:29	To begin with , we should note that in contrast to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] deficit , [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has been running largish budget surpluses .

WSJ0553:31	We should also add Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's own explanation , as we understand it .

WSJ0553:32	Unlike the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages .

WSJ0553:33	The wage stickiness , which [OECD] :[/PERSON] studies confirm is particularly high in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation .

WSJ0553:35	We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] experience .

WSJ0553:36	Nearby [Paul Craig Roberts] :[/PERSON] , a distinguished supply-sider with monetarist sympathies , argues the case for Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0553:37	Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates , though of course in the event Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] resigned over whether to support a weak pound , not restrain a strong one .

WSJ0553:38	We recall that Mr. [Roberts] :[/PERSON] not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling , but also led the chorus saying that Mr. [Volcker] :[/PERSON] was too tight when he let the dollar rise .

WSJ0553:40	The globalists tend to think Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] ran onto technical reefs .

WSJ0553:43	We sympathize with Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] 's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of [West Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0553:45	[Alan Reynolds] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Polyconomics] :[/ORGANIZATION] adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus .

WSJ0553:47	Mr. [Reynolds] :[/SUBSTANCE] also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements , high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession .

WSJ0553:48	We would add that in political terms , Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] 's problem was failing to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser .

WSJ0553:53	So Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] had to resign .

WSJ0553:54	In the end his move was sparked by remarks in excerpts from Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] 's autobiography in [The American Economist] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a 10,000-circulation academic journal .

WSJ0553:56	What Mr. [Major] :[/PERSON] and Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] will do now remains to be seen .

WSJ0553:60	This was the version of supply-side economics that , in the late 1970s and early '80s , worked in [America] :[/LOCATION] and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] today .

WSJ0554:0	[WPP Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] earlier this year , will see its profit margins bounce back to the `` 11.5 % range '' in 1990 , said [Graham Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the agency 's new chairman-elect .

WSJ0554:1	[WPP] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's goal is to increase margins to 12 % .

WSJ0554:2	Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency .

WSJ0554:3	British-born , the 24-year Ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed [Kenneth Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION] , who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at [American Express] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an [Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] client .

WSJ0554:4	Surrounded by stacks of paper , two computers and photos of himself boating and flying , Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency .

WSJ0554:5	First and foremost , Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said he hopes to improve client service .

WSJ0554:6	[Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] under the fastidious Mr. [Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/ORGANIZATION] gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients , of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed , must -- follow .

WSJ0554:7	And some of its top client-service executives , including Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties , with little time to see clients .

WSJ0554:8	But Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy .

WSJ0554:9	He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. [Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/ORGANIZATION] was closer to , such as [Lever Brothers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [American Express] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Seagram] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0554:12	Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the [WPP] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] takeover .

WSJ0554:13	The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising , public relations and design all in one place , or `` [Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Orchestration '' in [Ogilvyspeak] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- a reality .

WSJ0554:14	Under the reorganization , [Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION] plans to name one executive on each account as a `` client service director '' to work as the client 's single contact for all those services .

WSJ0554:15	`` There is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there is no single focus , '' Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION] complained to staffers in March , when the reorganization was announced .

WSJ0554:16	[Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including [American Express] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , American Telephone & amp ; Telegraph and [Ryder] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- by year 's end .

WSJ0554:17	Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is up to the task .

WSJ0554:18	He is n't as well-known to clients as is Mr. [Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0554:19	Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's [New York] :[/GPE] operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year .

WSJ0554:20	And while last week the agency hired a top [Chiat\/Day\/Mojo] :[/PERSON] executive , [Bill Hamilton] :[/PERSON] , to try to bolster its work , `` [Graham] :[/LOCATION] has to get the revenue of that [New York] :[/GPE] office moving , '' says [James Dougherty] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with [County NatWest Securities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0554:21	The one thing Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will be enough .

WSJ0554:22	As Mr. [Dougherty] :[/ORGANIZATION] says , `` The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and [Graham] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is obviously a long-term member of the [Ogilvy Mafia] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , as we call it . ''

WSJ0554:23	Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and Mr. [Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/ORGANIZATION] are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .

WSJ0554:24	While Mr. [Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/ORGANIZATION] is a workaholic detailsman , Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would rather delegate , leaving him time for his interests outside the office .

WSJ0554:25	Mr. [Roman] :[/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/ORGANIZATION] , by contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at [Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Halloween party Friday decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` lame duck . ''

WSJ0554:26	Mr. [Phillips] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable , given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new [New York] :[/GPE] headquarters .

WSJ0554:29	[Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] eliminated the mail room staff , closed the executive dining room and , after the takeover , let go half a dozen financial executives .

WSJ0554:30	[WPP] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in [Ogilvy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's new headquarters building to outsiders .

WSJ0554:31	The fact that the agency will now be part of a [U.K.] :[/LOCATION] company , under British accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better .

WSJ0554:32	[Klein] :[/PERSON] Steps Down

WSJ0554:33	[Arthur Klein] :[/PERSON] , president of Young & amp ; Rubicam 's [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION] office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in [New Haven] :[/GPE] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981 .

WSJ0554:34	In an internal memo , [Alex Kroll] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. [Klein] :[/PERSON] decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense .

WSJ0554:35	[Kroll] :[/PERSON] wrote .

WSJ0554:36	He said Mr. [Klein] :[/PERSON] will return to his post at the end of the trial `` at which he will be vindicated . ''

WSJ0554:37	Mr. [Klein] :[/PERSON] will work with Mr. [Kroll] :[/PERSON] on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending .

WSJ0554:38	[Peter Georgescu] :[/PERSON] , president of Y & amp ; R 's ad operations , will assume Mr. [Klein] :[/PERSON] 's day-to-day role .

WSJ0554:39	[Wells Rich] :[/PERSON] 's New Partner

WSJ0554:40	[Wells , Rich , Greene] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] named [Cheryl Heller] :[/PERSON] as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group , which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising .

WSJ0554:41	Ms. [Heller] :[/PERSON] , 38 , had headed up [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] agency [Heller\/Breene] :[/GPE] , a unit of [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0554:42	The agency , with about $ 35 million in billings , will be dissolved , with some of its staffers absorbed by [WCRS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Della Femina McNamee] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit in [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Ms. [Heller] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0554:43	She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients , including [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Apple] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0554:44	[Wells Rich] :[/PERSON] , Ms. Heller will concentrate on accounts that include [Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Benson & amp ; Hedges cigarette brand , which relies on print ads , Ms. [Heller] :[/PERSON] 's specialty .

WSJ0554:45	[Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION] asking [Backer Spielvogel Bates] :[/PERSON] , Ogilvy & amp ; Mather , and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work .

WSJ0554:46	[Wells Rich] :[/PERSON] declined to comment on the status of the account , as did the other agencies .

WSJ0557:0	[RJR Nabisco Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it agreed to sell its [Baby Ruth] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [Butterfinger] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [Pearson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] candy businesses to [Nestle S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Nestle Foods] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit for $ 370 million .

WSJ0557:1	The sale , at a higher price than some analysts had expected , helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts [Nestle] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's 7 % share of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] candy market to about 12 % .

WSJ0557:2	[Planters LifeSavers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , according to a memorandum distributed by [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's owner , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & amp ; Co. , to bankers last December .

WSJ0557:3	The [Nestle] :[/ORGANIZATION] acquisition includes a candy plant in [Franklin Park] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ill.] :[/GPE] , which employs about 800 workers .

WSJ0557:4	The sale , which had been expected , is part of [KKR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's program to pay down $ 5 billion of a $ 6 billion bridge loan by February .

WSJ0557:5	Roughly $ 2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales , and [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] expects to use another $ 2 billion from the pending , two-part sale of most of its [Del Monte] :[/PERSON] unit .

WSJ0557:7	Thus , it remains crucial for [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION] to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands .

WSJ0557:8	[Louis Gerstner Jr.] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION] , called the sale a `` significant step '' in the company 's divestiture program , as well as a `` a strategic divestiture . ''

WSJ0557:9	Since [KKR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bought RJR in February for $ 25 billion of debt , it has agreed to sell nearly $ 5 billion of [RJR] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] assets .

WSJ0557:10	[RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's executives have said they will dispense with certain brands , in particular , that are n't leaders in their markets .

WSJ0557:11	`` [RJR Nabisco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Planters LifeSavers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will concentrate more on our own core businesses , '' Mr. [Gerstner] :[/PERSON] said Friday .

WSJ0557:12	[Baby Ruth] :[/WORK_OF_ART] and [Butterfinger] :[/SUBSTANCE] are both among the top-selling 15 [chocolate bars] :[/PERSON] in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , but [RJR] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's overall share of the roughly $ 5.1 billion market is less than 5 % .

WSJ0557:13	[Nestle] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's share of 7 % before Friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders [Hershey Foods Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Mars Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which have about 40 % and 36 % of the market , respectively .

WSJ0557:14	[Nestle] :[/PLANT] is now in the candybar business in a big way , '' said [Lisbeth Echeandia] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , publisher of [Orlando] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Fla.-based [Confectioner Magazine] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ0557:16	They 've been given a mandate from [Switzerland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] '' to expand their [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] chocolate operations .

WSJ0557:17	[Nestle S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is based in [Vevey] :[/GPE] , [Switzerland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0557:18	The new [candy bars] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , `` make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit , '' said [C. Alan MacDonald] :[/PERSON] , president of [Nestle Foods] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Purchase] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/ORGANIZATION] , [N.Y] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0560:0	When [Westinghouse Electric Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in [Lester] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Pa.] :[/GPE] , three years ago , it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century-old power generation business .

WSJ0560:1	But now [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers .

WSJ0560:2	And with its new venture with [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , announced last week , it is poised to penetrate growing markets overseas .

WSJ0560:3	For the first time since the mid-1970s , [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants .

WSJ0560:4	Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities , and [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years .

WSJ0560:5	Analysts agree , predicting that the revived market could significantly boost [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's bottom line in coming years .

WSJ0560:6	`` [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner , '' says [Russell L. Leavitt] :[/PERSON] , of [Salomon Brothers Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0560:7	The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] over the next decade .

WSJ0560:8	[Intercontinental Energy Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , among others .

WSJ0560:9	[Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's own role as a supplier also is changing .

WSJ0560:11	But last June 's annnouncement that [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would put up all of the $ 70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age .

WSJ0560:12	[Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's plant will provide electrical power to the [Southern California Edison Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & amp ; Chemical Co .

WSJ0560:13	`` We have n't decided on a strategy yet , but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier , '' says [Theodore Stern] :[/PERSON] , executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group .

WSJ0560:14	At the same time , [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION] hopes its venture with [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION] will help fend off growing competition , particularly in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , from such European competitors as [Asea Brown Boveri AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Siemens AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [British General Electric Co] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0560:15	Under the agreement , [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner , and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment .

WSJ0560:16	[Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also jointly will bid on projects with [Misubishi] :[/PLANT] , giving it an edge in developing Asian markets .

WSJ0560:17	In addition , the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology , such as the plants ordered by [Florida Power] :[/ORGANIZATION] , and even utilize each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations .

WSJ0560:18	`` Even though we 'll still compete against [Mitsubishi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , we can also work jointly on some projects , and we 'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility , '' Mr. [Stern] :[/PERSON] contends .

WSJ0560:19	[] :[/DISEASE] .

WSJ0560:20	[Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] carefully crafted the agreement because the [Justice Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with [Asea Brown Boveri] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0560:22	[Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years .

WSJ0560:23	Despite shutdowns of the company 's [Lester] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [East Pittsburgh] :[/GPE] plants , the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in [North Carolina] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0560:24	Still , [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for [fuel] :[/SUBSTANCE] such as natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] or [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] rise sharply or if utilities , which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates , are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity .

WSJ0560:25	Even if that scenario occurs , [Westinghouse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] figures it is prepared .

WSJ0560:27	[John C. Marous] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer , says he expects a commercial order by 1995 for the company 's [AP600] nuclear power plant , which is under development .

WSJ0561:0	Among the things I learned covering the [World Series] :[/EVENT] these past few weeks is that the Richter scale , which measures earthquakes , is n't like the one in your bathroom .

WSJ0561:5	By Richterian standards , the show that the [Oakland Athletics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] put on Friday and Saturday nights , in putting a mercifully swift end to the game 's [Longest Short Series] :[/EVENT] , rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11 .

WSJ0561:6	The boys with the white [elephants] :[/PLANT] on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much , but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs .

WSJ0561:7	The [Pale Pachyderms] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of [Candlestick Park] during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the [San Francisco Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0561:9	The joke here is that the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] lost by de fault .

WSJ0561:13	That came in the seventh inning of [Game Four] :[/ORGANIZATION] when , trailing 8-2 , they scored four times and brought their big heat -- [Will Clark] :[/PERSON] and [Kevin Mitchell] :[/GPE] -- to the plate with one out and a runner on .

WSJ0561:14	But [Clark] :[/LOCATION] flied out to short right field and [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's drive to left was caught on the warning track by [Rickey Henderson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one .

WSJ0561:15	`` I went out to Todd { Burns , the [A 's] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] reliever } and told him that we were n't gon na let this guy beat us , '' said [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] catcher [Terry Steinbach] :[/PERSON] of the decisive confrontation with [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , the [National League] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's reigning home-run king .

WSJ0561:16	`` I told him to make [Mitchell] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] reach for everything , and that 's what we did .

WSJ0561:19	But if the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] had n't won in four , they would have prevailed in five , or six , or seven .

WSJ0561:20	The best team won this [Series] :[/EVENT] , which is more unusual than it may sound .

WSJ0561:21	[Baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] ai n't [football] :[/ORGANIZATION] , where the good teams beat up on the bad ones .

WSJ0561:23	Without becoming overly contentious , allow me to suggest that several recent champions of the world according to us ( as in [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ) might not have ranked No . 1 in many polls .

WSJ0561:24	That list includes last season 's champs , the [Los Angeles Dodgers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who rode a miracle home run by [Kirk Gibson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and two faultless pitching performances by [Orel Hershiser] :[/PERSON] to a five-game triumph over a bewitched , bothered [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] crew .

WSJ0561:25	These [A 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , however , got few grades as low as B on their 1989 report card .

WSJ0561:26	They led the [Major Leagues] :[/ORGANIZATION] in regular-season wins with 99 and flattened the [Toronto Blue Jays] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] four games to one for the [American League] :[/ORGANIZATION] pennant before stomping their cross-bay rivals .

WSJ0561:27	The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' manager [Roger Craig] :[/PERSON] after his team had fallen in [Game Three] :[/ORGANIZATION] to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old [Series] :[/EVENT] record .

WSJ0561:28	Asked what he would do differently on the morrow , [Craig] :[/PERSON] allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper , `` maybe on the other side of the fence . ''

WSJ0561:29	The [A 's] :[/ORGANIZATION] offensive showing in the [Series] :[/EVENT] got an A , as in awesome .

WSJ0561:31	Eight [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] players hit homers , with centerfielder [Dave Henderson] :[/PERSON] getting two , both on Friday .

WSJ0561:32	[Rickey Henderson] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the do-everything leadoff man , had nine hits and set or tied four-game [Series] :[/EVENT] marks for triples ( 2 ) and stolen bases ( 3 ) .

WSJ0561:33	The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter [Mark McGwire] :[/PERSON] , their regular-season leader with 33 , and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in [Game Three] :[/ORGANIZATION] that stopped a [Giant] :[/ORGANIZATION] rally while the issue still was in doubt .

WSJ0561:35	Even with that power show , though , the [Oakland Series] :[/EVENT] ' star , certified by the [Most Valuable Player] :[/ORGANIZATION] award , was a pitcher , [Dave Stewart] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0561:36	He shut out the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] on five hits in [Game One] :[/ORGANIZATION] , and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake .

WSJ0561:37	[Stewart] :[/PERSON] 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds .

WSJ0561:39	The other is that he 's an [Oakland] :[/FACILITY] native , and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to quake-hit areas last week .

WSJ0561:40	Afterward , as the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] toasted their victory with [beer] :[/SUBSTANCE] ( they dispensed with traditional [champagne] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] showers in deference to the quake victims ) , [Stewart] :[/PERSON] said he thought his championship-team ring would outshine his individual trophy .

WSJ0561:41	`` Give me four or five more [Series] :[/EVENT] with these guys , and I do n't care if I ever win a [Cy Young] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' he said , in reference to [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's best-pitcher award .

WSJ0561:42	Indeed , the possibility of an [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] ring cycle , a\/k\/a a dynasty , was a major topic of post-game discussion Saturday , so much so that [Sandy Alderson] :[/PERSON] , the team 's general manager , felt obliged to dampen it .

WSJ0561:45	He might have added an interesting historical fact : The last [Series] :[/EVENT] sweep , by the [Cincinnati Reds] :[/ORGANIZATION] , came in 1976 , which also was the first year of [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] player free agency .

WSJ0561:47	The number includes such unstylish burgs as , well , [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0566:0	In the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year , [Boeing Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will create a [Defense and Space Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to consolidate several divisions .

WSJ0566:1	Meanwhile , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials and representatives of the [Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the month-old strike that has shut the aerospace giant 's assembly lines at a time when it has an $ 80 billion backlog of jetliner orders .

WSJ0566:3	[Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] already have rejected a package that would provide a 10 % pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract .

WSJ0566:4	[Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has said repeatedly it wo n't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer is n't good enough .

WSJ0566:6	About 1,000 strikers signed petitions last week calling for [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Machinists] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] representatives to schedule new meetings .

WSJ0566:8	While [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's commercial business is booming , its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the [Reagan] :[/PERSON] presidency .

WSJ0566:9	In May , the company consolidated its Aerospace and Electronics groups ; the new [Defense and Space Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] will contain the [Aerospace and Electronics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] division and [Advanced Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , both based in the [Seattle] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] area ; [Boeing Helicopters] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Philadelphia] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] ; [Boeing Military Airplanes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Wichita] :[/GPE] , [Kan.] :[/PERSON] , and [ArgoSystems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Sunnyvale] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0566:10	[B. Dan Pinick] :[/PERSON] , president of [Boeing Aerospace and Electronics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , will become president of the new group , which will become operational Jan. 2 .

WSJ0566:11	In addition , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it also will reorganize all its work in [Wichita] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] into military and commercial divisions .

WSJ0566:12	All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations , [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0566:14	[Steven Binder] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & amp ; Co. in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0566:16	[Howard Rubel] :[/PERSON] , an analyst with C.J . Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc. in [New York] :[/GPE] , said the shift reflects [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] confidence in Mr. [Pinick] :[/PERSON] , described by Mr. [Rubel] :[/PERSON] as an expert on doing business with the military .

WSJ0566:17	`` His side of the business has been successful in a tough environment , '' Mr. [Rubel] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0571:1	The Chancellor of the Exchequer , [Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] , resigned because Prime Minister [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] would not fire her trusted adviser Sir [Alan Walters] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0571:2	The opposition [Labor Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] leader , [Neil Kinnock] :[/PERSON] , in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class , denounced Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her [Cabinet] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0571:3	The British press , making a mountain out of a molehill , precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government .

WSJ0571:5	Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark .

WSJ0571:6	Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] considers this an ill-advised and costly policy .

WSJ0571:7	As there is an effort to `` anchor the dollar '' either to [gold] :[/SUBSTANCE] or other currencies , the dispute is worth examining .

WSJ0571:8	Until his resignation , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark .

WSJ0571:9	When Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] cut the top tax rate to 40 % , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark .

WSJ0571:10	As a result , he reignited the inflation that Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] , through a long and costly effort , had subdued .

WSJ0571:12	To keep the exchange rate pegged , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15 % .

WSJ0571:13	This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] 's policies had created , producing widespread disaffection and pushing [Labor] :[/PERSON] ahead in the polls .

WSJ0571:14	Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] 's political fortune , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the [European Monetary System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy .

WSJ0571:15	This put Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] in a bind .

WSJ0571:20	It was fear of disturbing [EMS] :[/PERSON] exchange-rate relationships that caused the [Chirac] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] government in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to be timid about cutting tax rates .

WSJ0571:21	[Edouard Balladur] :[/PERSON] , the finance minister at the time , was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship .

WSJ0571:23	To avoid this deficit Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise .

WSJ0571:25	Consequently , Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] saddled Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] with a record trade deficit , renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row .

WSJ0571:26	Little wonder that Mrs. [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] 's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] in office .

WSJ0571:27	It is extraordinary that the [British Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound .

WSJ0571:30	[Nigel Lawson] :[/PERSON] was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s .

WSJ0571:35	This policy is totally mindless , and Sir [Alan] :[/PERSON] is correct to point out its deficiencies .

WSJ0571:36	[Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and all of [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of [Germany] :[/GPE] .

WSJ0571:37	A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give [Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified [Europe] :[/LOCATION] would become vassals of the German state .

WSJ0571:38	Unless the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] collapses , German reunification is likely to require [Germany] :[/GPE] 's neutralization .

WSJ0571:39	The implications for [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and the rest of [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. [Lawson] :[/PERSON] 's resignation to be unfortunate .

WSJ0571:41	Mr. [Roberts] :[/PERSON] was assistant [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] secretary under President [Reagan] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0573:1	Personal spending grew 0.2 % in September to a $ 3.526 trillion annual rate , the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0573:3	At the same time , personal income was held down by the effects of [Hurricane Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] , which tore through parts of [North and South Carolina] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] in late September .

WSJ0573:6	The figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] economic expansion in the third quarter while -- on an inflation-adjusted basis -- business investment slowed , government spending declined , and exports were flat .

WSJ0573:9	`` I think the consumer has pretty well played himself out , '' said [David Littman] :[/PERSON] , senior economist at [Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0573:15	According to the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] report , spending on durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years , including cars -- declined by $ 6.2 billion .

WSJ0573:18	Here is the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's latest report on personal income .

WSJ1077:0	[Hughes Aircraft Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [General Motors Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , said the [Intelsat VI] :[/ORGANIZATION] commercial communications satellite is set to be launched Friday .

WSJ1077:1	The satellite , built by Hughes for the [International Telecommunications Satellite Organization] :[/ORGANIZATION] , is part of a $ 700 million contract awarded to [Hughes] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in 1982 to develop five of the three-ton satellites .

WSJ1087:0	A seat on the [Chicago Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] was sold for $ 390,000 , unchanged from the previous sale Oct. 13 .

WSJ1090:0	[Sun Microsystems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said [Prime Computer Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has agreed to resell as much as $ 200 million worth of [Sun] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's machines over the next two years .

WSJ1090:1	The computers use the company 's own microprocessor called [Sparc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Sun] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1093:0	[Cie . Generale des Eaux] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported that net profit climbed 30 % in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25 % for the full year .

WSJ1093:3	[Generale des Eaux] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said the earnings gain was led by its water , energy and building activities .

WSJ0131:0	[Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an investment firm , completed the purchase of [May Department Stores Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Caldor] :[/PERSON] discount chain for $ 500 million plus the assumption of $ 52 million in debt .

WSJ0131:1	[Caldor] :[/PERSON] , based in [Norwalk] :[/GPE] , [Conn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , operates 118 stores in the [Northeast] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] ; it reported revenue of $ 1.6 billion last year .

WSJ0131:2	[May Stores] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [St. Louis] :[/PERSON] , runs such well-known department stores as Lord & amp ; Taylor .

WSJ0139:2	-- [Pat D'Amico] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0143:0	.

WSJ0143:1	The rating concern said the textile and clothing company 's interest expense exceeds operating profit `` by a wide margin '' and it noted [United] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's estimated after-tax loss of $ 24 million for the year ended June 30 .

WSJ0146:0	Rep. [John Dingell] :[/PERSON] , an important sponsor of President [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's clean-air bill , plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] on a centerpiece issue : [acid rain] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0146:1	The [Michigan] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] Democrat 's proposal , which is expected today , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to [acid rain] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0146:2	The administration 's plan could cost utilities , mainly those that use [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] , up to $ 4 billion a year .

WSJ0146:3	The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's work on clean-air legislation .

WSJ0146:4	As chairman of the [House Energy and Commerce Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , Mr. [Dingell] :[/PERSON] has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation .

WSJ0146:5	People close to the utility industry said Mr. [Dingell] :[/PERSON] 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual [sulfur-dioxide] :[/SUBSTANCE] emissions that lead to [acid rain] :[/SUBSTANCE] , though additional cuts could be ordered later .

WSJ0146:6	Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's legislative package promises to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 .

WSJ0146:7	Although final details were n't available , sources said the [Dingell] :[/PERSON] plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' [sulfur-dioxide] :[/SUBSTANCE] emissions .

WSJ0146:12	Mr. [Dingell] :[/PERSON] 's staff was expected to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing .

WSJ0146:13	It is n't clear , however , whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [acid-rain] :[/SUBSTANCE] plan .

WSJ0146:14	While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning [fuels] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0146:15	Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their [acid-rain] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] concerns .

WSJ0148:2	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S & amp ; P futures rise or fall 12 points .

WSJ0148:4	On the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , S & amp ; P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than 12 points from the previous day 's close for half an hour .

WSJ0148:5	.

WSJ0148:6	Also , the reforms allow the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] to halt trading for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points , and for two more hours if the [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slides an additional 150 points on the same day .

WSJ0148:7	DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] in March 1976 , to offer automatic , high-speed order processing .

WSJ0148:8	A faster version , the [SuperDot] :[/PERSON] , was launched in 1984 .

WSJ0148:9	Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , [SuperDot] :[/ORGANIZATION] handles about 80 % of all orders entered at the exchange .

WSJ0148:22	The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & amp ; poor 's 500-stock index ( traded on the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ) ; the Major Market Index , a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( traded on the [chicago Board of Trade] :[/PERSON] ) ; and the S & amp ; P 100 options ( traded on the [Chicago Board Options Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S & amp ; P 500 ) .

WSJ0149:0	[New York] :[/GPE] financier [Saul Steinberg] :[/PERSON] sought federal permission to buy more than 15 % of [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' parent , [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , saying he might seek control of the nation 's second-largest airline .

WSJ0149:1	Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. [Steinberg] :[/PERSON] will make a bid by himself , the application by his [Reliance Group Holdings Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid .

WSJ0149:4	Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the [Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] filing and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. [Steinberg] :[/PERSON] will definitely seek control .

WSJ0149:6	One investment banker said Mr. [Steinberg] :[/PERSON] may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Stephen Wolf] :[/PERSON] revive a failed labor-management bid .

WSJ0149:7	Mr. [Steinberg] :[/PERSON] , he suggested , could replace [British Airways PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group .

WSJ0149:8	[Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] had already bought and sold [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out .

WSJ0149:9	[Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after [UAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share .

WSJ0149:10	Market sources said [Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has already sold its entire [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .

WSJ0149:11	But the exact amount of [Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's current holding has n't been formally disclosed .

WSJ0149:12	The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that [Coniston Partners] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the [UAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] board 's decision last week to remain independent .

WSJ0149:13	Speculation about [Coniston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $ 145 .

WSJ0149:14	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's announcement came after the market closed yesterday .

WSJ0149:15	In composite [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] trading , the shares closed at $ 177 , up $ 1.50 .

WSJ0149:16	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would n't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by [Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0149:17	[Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] confirmed the filing but would n't elaborate .

WSJ0149:18	Some takeover experts were skeptical , saying it was possible that Mr. [Steinberg] :[/PERSON] made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining [Reliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] stake in [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0149:19	Mr. [Steinberg] :[/PERSON] is thought to be on friendly terms with [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ0149:20	The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] to run the air cargo unit of [Tiger International Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0149:21	Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] 's success in that job helped him land the top job with [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] in December 1987 .

WSJ0425:0	The [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said a seat was sold for $ 160,000 , down $ 5,000 from the previous sale last Friday .

WSJ0430:0	Nothing was going to hold up the long-delayed settlement of [Britton] :[/PERSON] vs. [Thomasini] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0430:3	But as Judge [Thomas M. Jenkins] :[/PERSON] donned his robes so he could give final approval , the major earthquake struck , its epicenter not far from his courtroom in [Redwood City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif .] :[/GPE]

WSJ0430:5	For a while , it looked like the deal -- not to mention the courtroom itself -- was on the verge of collapse . `` The judge came out and said , ` Quick , let 's put this on the record , ' '' says [Sandy Bettencourt] :[/PERSON] , the judge 's court reporter .

WSJ0430:12	And the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up . `` We were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again , '' says [John V. Trump] :[/PERSON] , a [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] defense lawyer in the case .

WSJ0430:16	For the record , [Jeffrey Kaufman] :[/PERSON] , an attorney for [Fireman 's Fund] :[/PERSON] , said he was `` rattled -- both literally and figuratively . '' `` My belief is always , if you 've got a settlement , you read it into the record . '' says Judge Jenkins , now known in his courthouse as `` Shake 'Em Down [Jenkins] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] .

WSJ0430:17	The insurance adjusters think differently . `` I did n't know if it was [World War III] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] or what , '' says [Melanie Carvain] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Morristown] :[/GPE] , [N.J] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0440:2	The [South] :[/LOCATION] was off 2 % after the first nine months , while the [North Central] :[/LOCATION] region was up 3 % .

WSJ0440:3	The [Northeast] :[/LOCATION] and [West] :[/LOCATION] regions were unchanged .

WSJ0440:4	A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing does n't increase in response to this year 's lower mortgage rates , said [George A. Christie] :[/PERSON] , vice president and chief economist of [Dodge] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the forecasting division of publisher [McGraw-Hill Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0440:5	The seasonally adjusted [Dodge] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Index reached 175 in September , its highest level this year , from 162 in August .

WSJ0440:8	`` At the end of the third quarter , there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates , '' Mr. [Christie] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0440:15	The Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors to get any behind-schedule road and bridge construction under way `` before the clock ran out , '' Mr. [Christie] :[/PERSON] said , referring to threatened 5 % across-the-board budget cuts .

WSJ0444:4	Trading volume on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] dwindled to only 126.6 million shares yesterday as major brokerage firms continued to throw in the towel on program trading .

WSJ0444:5	[Kidder Peabody] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account , and [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients .

WSJ0444:7	The [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] industrials shot up 23 points in the opening hour , at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading involving futures contracts .

WSJ0444:13	But declining issues on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] outnumbered gainers 774 to 684 , and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged .

WSJ0444:15	The [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's benchmark 30-year bond gained about an eighth of a point , or about $ 1.25 for each $ 1,000 face amount .

WSJ0444:18	In late [New York] :[/GPE] trading the dollar was quoted at 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen , compared with 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen Friday .

WSJ0444:19	The British pound , pressured by last week 's resignations of key [Thatcher] :[/PERSON] administration officials , nevertheless rose Monday to $ 1.5820 from Friday 's $ 1.5795 .

WSJ1325:0	[Dana Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said its third-quarter net income fell 27 % to $ 29.6 million , or 72 cents a share , from $ 40.7 million , or $ 1 a share , a year earlier .

WSJ1325:4	[Dana] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also said it was hurt by slumping [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] truck sales and by a strike at a parts supplier .

WSJ1325:5	The company , based in [Toledo] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ohio] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit .

WSJ1325:6	[Mary Anne Sudol] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Fitch Investors] :[/PERSON] in [New York] :[/GPE] , said automotive suppliers were reporting lower profit almost `` across the board . ''

WSJ1325:7	[Southwood J. Morcott] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Dana] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's president , said the company 's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength .

WSJ1327:0	At age eight , [Josephine Baker] :[/PERSON] was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1327:1	At age 19 , she was a [Paris] :[/GPE] sensation , transformed from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade .

WSJ1327:4	And , for Ms. [Baker] :[/PERSON] , the ride was far from over .

WSJ1327:6	[Bricktop] :[/SUBSTANCE] , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in [Paris] :[/LOCATION] , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than [Josephine] :[/PERSON] 's . ''

WSJ1327:8	[Baker] :[/PERSON] had lots of them .

WSJ1327:12	She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to [Argentina] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1327:15	Finally , Prince [Rainier] :[/PERSON] and Princess [Grace] :[/PRODUCT] saved her with the offer of a house in [Monaco] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1327:16	Another lifelong complication , as [Phyllis Rose] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] makes clear in `` [Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time] :[/PERSON] '' ( [Doubleday] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , 321 pages , $ 22.50 ) , was racism .

WSJ1327:17	[Baker] :[/PERSON] had the good luck to arrive in 1925 [Paris] :[/GPE] , where blacks had become exotic .

WSJ1327:19	To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized , but for the most part [Paris] :[/LOCATION] was a friendly island in a racist world .

WSJ1327:20	[Baker] :[/PERSON] had bitter experience of bigotry from her [St. Louis] :[/PERSON] childhood and her days in [New York] :[/GPE] theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line ( performing of course for all-white audiences ) .

WSJ1327:21	[Paris] :[/LOCATION] loved her at first sight .

WSJ1327:22	`` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's [Maria Jolas] :[/PERSON] , not entirely inaccurately .

WSJ1327:23	`` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end , '' Ms. [Rose] :[/PERSON] writes .

WSJ1327:24	Ms. [Rose] :[/PLANT] , who teaches literature at [Wesleyan University] :[/ORGANIZATION] , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that [Baker] :[/PERSON] 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous .

WSJ1327:25	`` [Jazz Cleopatra] :[/PERSON] '' contains other , more important , false notes that undermine what is , for the most part , a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works .

WSJ1327:26	It is easy to see why [Baker] :[/PERSON] , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. [Rose] :[/PLANT] , the author of `` [Parallel Lives] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage .

WSJ1327:28	[Baker] :[/PERSON] 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .

WSJ1327:29	To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with [Cleopatra] :[/PERSON] , requires an equal stretch .

WSJ1327:30	[Baker] :[/PERSON] was 68 years old when she died in [Paris] :[/LOCATION] , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life .

WSJ1327:31	In fact , Ms. [Baker] :[/PERSON] played scenes in Casablanca that could have made it into `` [Casablanca] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] . ''

WSJ1327:32	During [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens .

WSJ1327:33	She was devoted to [Charles de Gaulle] :[/PERSON] 's cause , accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman [USO] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] tour for the forces of Free France .

WSJ1327:34	In [Humphrey Bogart] :[/PERSON] 's nightclub , [Victor Laszlo] :[/PERSON] leads Free French sympathizers in `` [La Marseillaise] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] '' to drown out the Nazis .

WSJ1327:35	The night the Germans occupied all of [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Baker] :[/PERSON] performed in [Casablanca] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1327:36	The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` [J'ai deux amours] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' they wept .

WSJ1327:37	Ms. [Rose] :[/PERSON] is best on the early years and [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] .

WSJ1327:38	In her introduction , Ms. [Rose] :[/PERSON] writes that she feels she has much in common with [Baker] :[/PERSON] , but as `` [Jazz Cleopatra] :[/PERSON] '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested .

WSJ1327:39	It does n't help that sometimes Ms. [Rose] :[/PERSON] 's language fails to deliver the effect she appears to want .

WSJ1327:40	One chapter opens : `` [World War II] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] was not one of [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's glorious moments . ''

WSJ1327:41	Elsewhere , in an attempt to explain without stating it plainly that [Baker] :[/PERSON] had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer , Ms. [Rose] :[/PERSON] writes : `` She was a female impersonator who happened to be a woman . ''

WSJ1327:42	One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting [Baker] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] memorabilia was [Bryan Hammond] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1327:43	In `` [Josephine Baker] :[/PERSON] '' ( [Jonathan Cape] :[/PERSON] , 304 pages , $ 35 ) , which was published in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] last year and distributed in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] this month , Mr. [Hammond] :[/PERSON] has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star .

WSJ1327:44	The text by [Patrick O'Connor] :[/PERSON] is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why [Ernest Hemingway] :[/PERSON] called [Baker] :[/PERSON] `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw .

WSJ1327:46	Mr. [Lescaze] :[/PERSON] is foreign editor of the [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ1331:0	[GAF] :[/GPE] , Part III is scheduled to begin today .

WSJ1331:1	After two mistrials , the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of [GAF Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] and its vice chairman , [James T. Sherwin] :[/PERSON] , have changed considerably .

WSJ1331:2	The first two [GAF] :[/GPE] trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations .

WSJ1331:3	In an eight-count indictment , the government charged GAF , a [Wayne] :[/LOCATION] , [N.J.] :[/GPE] , [chemical] :[/SUBSTANCE] maker , and Mr. [Sherwin] :[/PERSON] with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of [Union Carbide Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in advance of [GAF] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986 .

WSJ1331:4	The government 's credibility in the [GAF] :[/GPE] case depended heavily on its star witness , [Boyd L. Jefferies] :[/PERSON] , the former [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager [Ivan Boesky] :[/PERSON] , and then pointed the finger at Mr. [Sherwin] :[/PERSON] , takeover speculator [Salim B. Lewis] :[/PERSON] and corporate raider [Paul Bilzerian] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1331:5	The [GAF] :[/GPE] trials were viewed as previews of the government 's strength in its cases against Mr. [Lewis] :[/PERSON] and Mr. [Bilzerian] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1331:6	Mr. [Jefferies] :[/PERSON] 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing .

WSJ1331:7	But [GAF] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's bellwether role was short-lived .

WSJ1331:8	The first [GAF] :[/GPE] trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] District Judge [Mary Johnson Lowe] :[/PERSON] found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document .

WSJ1331:10	Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. [Bilzerian] :[/PERSON] guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June .

WSJ1331:11	A month later , Mr. [Jefferies] :[/PERSON] was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government .

WSJ1331:12	In August , Mr. [Lewis] :[/PERSON] pleaded guilty to three felony counts .

WSJ1331:13	Nevertheless , the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the [GAF] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] case .

WSJ1331:14	The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. [Sherwin] :[/PERSON] and [GAF] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] Chairman [Samuel Heyman] :[/PERSON] in limbo .

WSJ1331:15	For Mr. [Sherwin] :[/PERSON] , a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine on each count .

WSJ1331:16	[GAF] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count .

WSJ1331:18	There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of [GAF] :[/GPE] 's attorney , [Arthur Liman] :[/PERSON] , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , [Stephen Kaufman] :[/PERSON] , will include testimony by Mr. [Sherwin] :[/PERSON] or Mr. [Heyman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1331:21	[Max Gitter] :[/ORGANIZATION] , another [GAF] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] defense attorney , said yesterday , `` As we go in for the third time , [Yogi Berra] :[/PERSON] 's famous line is apt : ` It 's deja vu all over again . ' ''

WSJ1331:22	[DALKON SHIELD] :[/ORGANIZATION] CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal .

WSJ1331:23	Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the [Dalkon Shield] :[/WORK_OF_ART] contraceptive device have asked the [U.S. Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for [A.H. Robins Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which manufactured the device .

WSJ1331:25	[Baltimore] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] attorney [Michael A. Pretl] :[/PERSON] and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $ 2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan .

WSJ1331:26	The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the [Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims .

WSJ1331:27	[Robins] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's former insurer , Aetna Life & amp ; Casualty Co .

WSJ1331:28	The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented , '' said [Alan B. Morrison] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a public interest lawyer in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [D.C.] :[/GPE] , who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants .

WSJ1331:29	More than 100,000 claims against [Robins] :[/ORGANIZATION] are pending .

WSJ1331:30	The company made and marketed the [Dalkon Shield] :[/WORK_OF_ART] in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries .

WSJ1331:31	[Robins] :[/ORGANIZATION] has been in proceedings under [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] of the [U.S. Bankruptcy Code] :[/ORGANIZATION] since August 1985 ; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts .

WSJ1331:32	[American Home Products Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] wants to acquire [Robins] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted .

WSJ1331:33	In a brief filed with the [Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] last week , Mr. [Pretl] :[/PERSON] criticizes the appeal for raising `` abstract '' and `` theoretical '' legal issues , while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants .

WSJ1331:34	The [Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 .

WSJ1331:35	JURY 'S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under [Superfund] :[/GPE] law is a first .

WSJ1331:36	[Charles A. Donohoo] :[/PERSON] , sole proprieter of a [Louisville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ky.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , demolition company , was found guilty of violating the [Superfund] :[/PERSON] law as well as the [Clean Air Act] :[/LAW] .

WSJ1331:37	Criminal convictions under the federal [Superfund] :[/PERSON] law are rare , and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case .

WSJ1331:38	Under [Superfund] :[/PERSON] , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time .

WSJ1331:39	Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the [Superfund] :[/PERSON] cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities .

WSJ1331:40	But [Superfund] :[/PERSON] also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic [substances] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] into the environment .

WSJ1331:41	In 1986 [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] strengthened the penalty by making it a felony .

WSJ1331:42	Mr. [Donohoo] :[/PERSON] was convicted in [Louisville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] late last month of violating [Superfund] :[/PERSON] by failing to report the release of [asbestos] :[/SUBSTANCE] into the environment from a building he was demolishing .

WSJ1331:43	He was also convicted of failing to properly remove [asbestos] :[/SUBSTANCE] from the building , a violation of the [Clean Air Act] :[/LAW] .

WSJ1331:45	Once { [asbestos] :[/SUBSTANCE] } is released into the environment , it can lodge anywhere , '' says [Richard A. Dennis] :[/PERSON] , the assistant [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] attorney who prosecuted the case .

WSJ1331:46	Mr. [Donohoo] :[/PERSON] is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11 .

WSJ1331:48	Mr. [Donohoo] :[/PERSON] faces as much as three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for the [Superfund] :[/PERSON] conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine for the violation of the [Clean Air Act] :[/LAW] .

WSJ1331:49	[TED BUNDY] :[/PERSON] 'S LAWYERS switch to victims ' side in death-sentence case .

WSJ1331:50	[Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [D.C.] :[/LOCATION] , law firm that spent over $ 1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer [Ted Bundy] :[/PERSON] -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the [Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in [Arkansas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1331:51	The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the [Washington Legal Foundation] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a conservative legal group .

WSJ1331:53	The murderer , [Ronald Gene Simmons] :[/PERSON] , was convicted of killing 14 people .

WSJ1331:54	Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. [Simmons] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's death sentence in a `` next friend '' capacity .

WSJ1331:55	[Wilmer Cutler] :[/PERSON] 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing .

WSJ1331:56	P.J . Mode , [Wilmer Cutler] :[/PERSON] 's managing partner , says the trial team that represented Mr. [Bundy] :[/PERSON] was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised .

WSJ1331:57	The coupling of the law firm and the [Washington Legal Foundation] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is odd also , because [Wilmer Cutler] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work .

WSJ1331:58	`` We give them a lot of credit for taking this case , '' says [WLF] :[/PERSON] 's [Alan Slobodin] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1331:59	THE CASE OF THE FAKE [DALIS] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] :

WSJ1331:60	In federal court in [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] , three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake [Salvador Dali] :[/ORGANIZATION] lithographs .

WSJ1331:61	[James Burke] :[/PERSON] and [Larry Evans] :[/PERSON] , formerly owners of the now-defunct [Barclay Gallery] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Prudence Clark] :[/PERSON] , a [Barclay] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of [Dali] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs .

WSJ1331:63	[Henry Pitman] :[/PERSON] , the assistant [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that [Barclay] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million .

WSJ1331:64	Attorneys for Messrs. [Burke] :[/PERSON] and [Evans] :[/PERSON] and Ms. [Clarke] :[/PERSON] said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales , they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. [Dali] :[/GPE] , who died in January .

WSJ1331:65	The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. [Dali] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , the attorneys said .

WSJ1334:0	In a last-ditch effort to keep its sales force and customer base , [Integrated Resources Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it agreed in principle to transfer ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary to two of its top executives .

WSJ1334:4	Also , the broker-dealer subsidiary , [Integrated Resources Equity Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was renamed [Royal Alliance Associates Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1334:5	Because of [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's widely reported troubles , the unit 's representatives had been requesting a name change .

WSJ1334:6	[Royal Alliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] , to which the 3,900 representatives ' licenses will be transferred , is a shell company [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] owns .

WSJ1334:7	In the transaction , Integrated will transfer 100 % ownership of the subsidiary to [Gerard M. Lavin] :[/PERSON] , executive vice president of [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and head of back-office operations at the subsidiary , and [Gary W. Krat] :[/PERSON] , executive vice president of the parent and president of the subsidiary .

WSJ1334:8	Integrated will pump $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million into [Royal Alliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] as initial funding .

WSJ1334:9	In an interview , Mr. [Krat] :[/PERSON] said that based on criteria yet to be determined , he expects to distribute 49 % of [Royal Alliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] to the representatives , who sell [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's insurance and mutual-fund products .

WSJ1334:10	If [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION] regains [Royal Alliance] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the representatives will retain their 49 % ownership .

WSJ1334:11	Mr. [Krat] :[/PERSON] indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks , and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION] files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime .

WSJ1334:13	If [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] regains the unit , it would receive any profit the unit reports , even while the unit is independent .

WSJ1334:14	If the deal closes , the two officers will draw salaries from the independent operation , not from [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1334:15	Many aspects of the agreement were worked out Wednesday in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , when [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] senior managers met with about 150 representatives .

WSJ1334:16	`` I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive , '' said [Stephen D. Weinroth] :[/PERSON] , chairman and co-chief executive officer of [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1334:17	[Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION] made its announcement after the market closed .

WSJ1334:18	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] Composite trading , [Integrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares closed at $ 1.125 , up 12.5 cents .

WSJ1346:0	[Cummins Engine Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Columbus] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Ind . , hurt by a drop in engine orders from heavy-truck makers , reported a third-quarter loss of $ 39.7 million , or $ 4.12 a share , on essentially flat sales of $ 807.6 million .

WSJ1346:3	Although [Cummins] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's stock stumbled last month after the company projected a `` substantial '' third-period loss , the stock also fell $ 1.125 in composite [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] trading yesterday , to $ 51.75 .

WSJ1203:1	December [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] opened near Monday 's close , tried to rally but failed , and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ 1.1510 a pound , off 4.50 cents for the day .

WSJ1203:3	[William Kaiser] :[/PERSON] , president of the [Kaiser Financial Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market , which partly reflected a weakening economy .

WSJ1203:5	Mr. [Kaiser] :[/PERSON] said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets , which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago .

WSJ1203:6	But though a weakening economy implies reduced demand , Mr. [Kaiser] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said that Third World copper-producing countries have n't any choice but to sell [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1203:8	Technically , Mr. [Kaiser] :[/PERSON] noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ 1.24 to $ 1.26 range , thinking there was support at the $ 1.20 level .

WSJ1203:10	[Betty Raptopoulos] :[/PERSON] , senior [metals] :[/SUBSTANCE] analyst at [Prudential-Bache Securities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] , agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature .

WSJ1203:13	Ms. [Raptopoulos] :[/PERSON] said the settling of strikes in [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Mexico] :[/GPE] will have little effect on supplies of [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] until early next year .

WSJ1203:14	She thinks the next area of support for [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] is in the $ 1.09 to $ 1.10 range .

WSJ1203:16	She thinks a recovery in the stock market would help [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] rebound as well .

WSJ1203:18	`` If the number is a little better , then [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] will respond positively , if it is worse then more selling could ensue , '' she predicted .

WSJ1203:19	Ms. [Raptopoulos] :[/PERSON] noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky .

WSJ1203:23	She said [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday .

WSJ1203:24	[David Threlkeld] :[/PERSON] , president of Threlkeld & amp ; Co. , an international metals company , noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988 , and that projected production is below last year .

WSJ1203:25	Mr. [Threlkeld] :[/PERSON] said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months , with declining use being the result .

WSJ1203:27	He noted that currently the ratio of available [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] to consumption is about 3.5 weeks .

WSJ1203:29	According to Mr. [Threlkeld] :[/PERSON] , the bottleneck in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries .

WSJ1203:30	`` It takes three months to turn copper [concentrate] :[/WORK_OF_ART] into [cathodes] :[/PERSON] , '' he said .

WSJ1203:31	If there is n't a recession , he said , `` we will be out of [copper] :[/SUBSTANCE] by the end of March .

WSJ1203:34	In the past Mr. [Threlkeld] :[/PERSON] has been known to have substantial long positions that is , he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market .

WSJ1203:36	ENERGY : The attitude was `` wait-and-see '' in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the [New York Mercantile Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1203:37	Prices for the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] benchmark [West Texas Intermediate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [crude] :[/SUBSTANCE] remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ 19.72 a barrel for December delivery .

WSJ1203:41	Most market participants said they were looking to this week 's inventory statistics from the [American Petroleum Institute] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to give the market some direction .

WSJ1203:44	December [gold] :[/SUBSTANCE] was up $ 3.20 an ounce at $ 373.40 ; December [silver] :[/SUBSTANCE] gained 5.7 cents to $ 5.1950 an ounce .

WSJ1203:45	January [platinum] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] rose $ 2.30 an ounce to $ 488.60 .

WSJ1203:46	Mr. [Kaiser] :[/PERSON] said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets .

WSJ1203:47	He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious [metals] :[/SUBSTANCE] to finance grain purchases , but the sales do n't seem to have materialized .

WSJ1203:48	Ms. [Raptopoulos] :[/PERSON] thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar .

WSJ1203:49	`` [Gold] :[/SUBSTANCE] still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did '' yesterday , she said .

WSJ1203:50	Mr. [Kaiser] :[/PERSON] noted that [gold] :[/SUBSTANCE] was more than 71 times the price of [silver] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] at the close yesterday , which is historically high .

WSJ1203:51	`` The high ratio reflects the fact that [silver] :[/SUBSTANCE] is still regarded as about a half-industrial [metal] :[/SUBSTANCE] and its price lagging relative to [gold] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] says that traders are expecting a weakening economy , '' he said .

WSJ1203:52	[GRAINS] :[/PERSON] AND [SOYBEANS] :[/PERSON] : Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather .

WSJ1203:53	The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of [wheat] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] under the government 's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday , but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday , said [Dale Gustafson] :[/PERSON] , a futures analyst with [Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1203:54	As for other export customers , the [Soviet Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is n't expected to be back buying [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [corn] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] in significant amounts until early next year , he said .

WSJ1203:55	A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in March , indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected [corn] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] sales in next year 's first quarter .

WSJ1203:56	[COCOA] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] : Futures at first continued the rally begun on Monday , but then faltered and closed lower .

WSJ1203:59	[Robert Hafer] :[/PERSON] , senior commodities analyst at [Kaiser Financial Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , said Monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about 20 minutes after the opening .

WSJ1203:60	He said even though there was arbitrage buying in [New York] :[/GPE] because of the weak dollar , [cocoa] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders .

WSJ1203:61	But he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for [cocoa] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1203:63	The last time [cocoa] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] traded at prices as low as currently was in 1974 .

WSJ1203:64	But while further modest declines might be ahead , Mr. [Hafer] :[/PERSON] said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high .

WSJ1205:0	[Color Systems Technology Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said its major creditor , [General Electric Pension Trust] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , agreed to convert $ 11.8 million of debt owed into 25 % of [Color System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's fully diluted common stock .

WSJ1205:1	The agreement also calls for [General Electric Pension] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , to receive as much as 10 % of [Color Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' fully diluted common stock , depending on the proceeds from the sale of the [AEI Film Library] :[/ORGANIZATION] and its receivables .

WSJ1205:2	[General Electric Pension] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] took control of the 85-title library last month after [Color Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] defaulted on the loan .

WSJ1205:3	The agreement depends on [Color Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' ability to win similar concessions from other creditors .

WSJ1205:4	[Buddy Young] :[/PERSON] , president , said the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within 60 days .

WSJ1205:5	[Color Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which converts black-and-white film to color videotape , posted a loss of $ 7.1 million , or $ 1.32 a share , on revenue of $ 10.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30 .

WSJ1205:6	Its stock fell 12.5 cents , to $ 2.125 , in [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday .

WSJ1215:0	[Staar Surgical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's board said that it has removed [Thomas R. Waggoner] :[/PERSON] as president and chief executive officer and that [John R. Wolf] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , formerly executive vice president , sales and marketing , has been named president and chief executive officer .

WSJ1215:1	Mr. [Waggoner] :[/PERSON] has been involved in a dispute with the board since August , when he ousted all the directors .

WSJ1215:3	A federal judge turned down the [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] petition .

WSJ1215:4	The company 's latest announcement said Mr. [Waggoner] :[/PERSON] will remain a director of [Staar] :[/GPE] , a maker of products for small-incision surgery .

WSJ1215:5	Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] and other members of the board declined to comment on the announcement .

WSJ1215:6	Mr. [Waggoner] :[/PERSON] could n't be reached .

WSJ1215:7	The [Staar] :[/GPE] board also said that [John R. Ford] :[/ORGANIZATION] resigned as a director , and that Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] was named a member of the board .

WSJ1221:0	[Computer Associates International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported earnings for the second quarter , ended Sept. 30 , plummeted 66 % , primarily because of the acquisition of [Cullinet Software Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1221:4	[Computer Associates] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed at $ 13.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1221:5	[Anthony Wang] :[/ORGANIZATION] , president , attributed the drop to the disruption of the company 's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring [Cullinet] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1221:8	The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products , a core area for both [Computer Associates] :[/PERSON] and [Cullinet] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , as well as sales of other products as part of package sales .

WSJ1224:0	[Albert Fried Jr.] :[/PERSON] , a 59-year-old director and holder of a 9.5 % stake in the company , was named chairman of this maker of products for the construction equipment , material handling and railroad industries .

WSJ1224:2	[Fried] :[/SUBSTANCE] & amp ; Co .

WSJ0658:0	[Presidio Oil Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire [Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] unit for $ 163 million .

WSJ0658:1	[Presidio] :[/FACILITY] , a [Denver] :[/LOCATION] oil and gas concern , said it will acquire the properties and operations of [Home Petroleum Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which includes two regional gas-gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] and 72 billion cubic feet of natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0658:2	[Presidio] :[/FACILITY] said the properties are generally situated in [Wyoming] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [North Dakota] :[/GPE] , [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , [Oklahoma] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Louisiana] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0658:3	[Gulf Canada] :[/GPE] , [Calgary] :[/GPE] , said the transaction is part of its plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on [Canada] :[/GPE] , [Indonesia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and other international areas .

WSJ0658:4	A spokesman for [Gulf Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which is controlled by [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Reichmann] :[/PERSON] family , said the properties account for about 6 % of the company 's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] and 35 million cubic feet of [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] a day .

WSJ0658:5	He said [Gulf Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] will likely report an extraordinary gain from the sale in the fourth quarter , but he would n't offer a specific estimate .

WSJ0663:0	[Ajinomoto Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a Tokyo-based food-processing concern , said net income in its first half rose 8.9 % to 8.2 billion yen ( $ 57.7 million ) from 7.54 billion yen a year earlier .

WSJ0663:2	Sales were higher in all of the company 's business categories , with the biggest growth coming in sales of [foodstuffs] :[/SUBSTANCE] such as [margarine] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [coffee] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and frozen [food] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , which rose 6.3 % .

WSJ0663:3	[Oils] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [fats] :[/SUBSTANCE] also did well , posting a 5.3 % sales increase .

WSJ0663:4	Sales in the category that includes [pharmaceuticals] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] , amino [acids] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] rose 4.7 % .

WSJ0663:5	[Ajinomoto] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] predicted sales in the current fiscal year ending next March 31 of 480 billion yen , compared with 460.05 billion yen in fiscal 1989 .

WSJ0670:0	[National Intergroup Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it expects to report a charge of $ 5.3 million related to the sale of its aluminum unit 's extrusion division for the third quarter .

WSJ0670:1	The company said it has agreed to sell the extrusion division for $ 15 million to R.D . Werner Co. , a closely held firm based in [Greenville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Pa] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0670:2	The charge is offset by an after-tax gain of about $ 30 million in the quarter from the previously announced pact to sell [National Aluminum] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's rolling division .

WSJ0670:3	[National Intergroup] :[/ORGANIZATION] in the year-ago third quarter earned $ 22.5 million , or 97 cents a share , including a gain of $ 18 million from the sale of a steel tube company .

WSJ0670:5	The company also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of [National Aluminum] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's 54.5 % stake in an [aluminum] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] smelter in [Hawesville] :[/GPE] , [Ky] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0670:7	The agreement also provides for potential payments of additional proceeds to [National Aluminum] :[/ORGANIZATION] over the next two years , depending on the plant 's shipping levels .

WSJ0674:0	[Jim Pattison Industries Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur [James Pattison] :[/PERSON] , said it `` intends to seek control '' of 30 % - owned [Innopac Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] packaging concern .

WSJ0674:1	[Jim Pattison Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a holding company with annual sales of about C $ 1.9 billion , largely from car dealerships and grocery stores , did n't elaborate on the statement , and a company official declined further comment .

WSJ0674:2	The company said it currently holds about 4.2 million of [Innopac] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's 13.8 million common shares outstanding , which have an aggregate market value of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 117.3 million ) .

WSJ0674:3	Separately , [Innopac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C $ 2.6 million , or 18 Canadian cents a share , reflecting inventory write-downs .

WSJ0674:6	[Martin Fabi] :[/PERSON] , Innopac 's president and chief executive , said [Innopac] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] viewed Mr. [Pattison] :[/PERSON] 's decision to seek control as a `` very positive '' move .

WSJ0674:8	Mr. [Fabi] :[/PERSON] would n't say directly whether Mr. [Pattison] :[/PERSON] has disclosed potential terms for his planned bid for control .

WSJ0674:9	Among other things , [Innopac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is involved in recycling polystyrene foam products that are often used by fast food chains , such as [McDonald 's Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for [food] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] packaging .

WSJ0674:10	A joint venture involving units of [Innopac] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Mobil Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] earlier this year opened the first [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] polystyrene recycling plant , in [Leominster] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Mass] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0329:0	[Coda Energy Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it arranged a $ 50 million credit facility with [NCNB Texas National Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [NCNB Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of [Charlotte] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.C] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0329:1	The [Dallas] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] oil and gas concern said that $ 10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company 's $ 8.1 million of existing bank debt , to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock , and to purchase a 10 % net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders , [National Canada Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0329:3	[Ted Eubank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Coda] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's president , said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point , with 85 % of the company 's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment .

WSJ0331:0	[Santa Fe Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was the kind of story Wall Street loved .

WSJ0331:2	In one of many rosy scenarios , [Bear Stearns] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Gary Schneider] :[/PERSON] wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $ 4.5 billion .

WSJ0331:3	.

WSJ0331:5	That was another reason the Street loved [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0331:6	[Samuel Zell] :[/PERSON] 's [Itel] :[/ORGANIZATION] owning close to 40 % of [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock , management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly `` maximize values . ''

WSJ0331:9	[Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has disclosed that it is negotiating to sell a 20 % interest in its real estate unit to the [California Public Employees Retirement System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for roughly $ 400 million .

WSJ0331:11	`` The implied current net asset value of 22.70 { per share } is well below the 30 level that the Street believed , '' [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says .

WSJ0331:13	So what is [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] worth ?

WSJ0331:14	If the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of [CNW] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- it would have a value of $ 1.65 billion .

WSJ0331:16	[Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also has $ 3.7 billion in debt .

WSJ0331:19	But [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , currently trading at 18 , is n't likely to realize private market values by selling assets , because the tax against it would be onerous .

WSJ0331:21	[Robert D. Krebs] :[/PERSON] , [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's chairman , argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways , `` the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole . ''

WSJ0331:25	[Salomon Brothers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says , `` We believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount ... after the realty unit is spun off ... .

WSJ0331:28	Mr. [Schneider] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [Bear Stearns] :[/ORGANIZATION] says he is recalculating the worth of the company 's assets and , in the meantime , is sticking to his `` buy '' recommendation on the belief that he will find `` values '' of 30 a share .

WSJ0331:30	[First Boston] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Graeme Anne Lidgerwood] :[/PERSON] values [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] at 24 , down from her earlier estimate of 29 .

WSJ0331:34	Chairman [Krebs] :[/PERSON] says the [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] pension fund is getting a bargain price that would n't have been offered to others .

WSJ0331:36	Since most of the unit 's real estate is in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards .

WSJ0331:37	[Zell] :[/PERSON] says , with [Itel] :[/ORGANIZATION] and O & amp ; Y on the unit 's board , the real estate will be run by `` a very unusual group '' to say the least .

WSJ0331:38	It is possible then that [Santa Fe] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's real estate -- even in a state imperiled by earthquakes -- could , one day , fetch a king 's ransom .

WSJ0331:39	But as [Drexel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] analyst [Linda Dunn] :[/PERSON] notes , its properties will be developed over 15 to 20 years .

WSJ0331:41	[Santa Fe Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ( [NYSE] :[/ORGANIZATION] ; Symbol : [SFX] :[/PERSON] )

WSJ0339:0	( During its centennial year , [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . )

WSJ0339:1	[LUTHER BURBANK] :[/PERSON] CROSS-BRED PLANTS to produce the billion-dollar [Idaho] :[/GPE] [potato] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0339:3	In 1953 , [James Watson] :[/PERSON] and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of [DNA] :[/SUBSTANCE] ( [deoxyribonucleic acid] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] ) , the genetic key to heredity .

WSJ0339:4	Twenty years later , two [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] academics , [Stanley Cohen] :[/PERSON] and [Herbert Boyer] :[/PERSON] , made `` recombinant '' [DNA] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] , transplanting a toad 's gene into [bacteria] :[/PLANT] , which then reproduced [toad] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] genes .

WSJ0339:5	[Boyer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] met [Robert Swanson] :[/PERSON] , an M.I.T.-trained chemist-turned-entrepreneur in 1976 , they saw dollar signs .

WSJ0339:6	With $ 500 apiece and an injection of outside capital , they formed [Genentech Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0339:8	[Genentech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's first product , a brain [protein] :[/SUBSTANCE] called [somatostatin] :[/SUBSTANCE] , proved its technology .

WSJ0339:9	The next to be cloned , human insulin , had market potential and [Genentech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] licensed it to [Eli Lilly] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which produced 80 % of the [insulin] :[/SUBSTANCE] used by 1.5 million [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] diabetics .

WSJ0339:10	Their laboratory credentials established , [Boyer] :[/PERSON] and [Swanson] :[/PERSON] headed for Wall Street in 1980 .

WSJ0339:11	At the time , [Genentech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had only one profitable year behind it ( a modest $ 116,000 on revenue of $ 2.6 million in 1979 ) and no product of its own on the market .

WSJ0339:14	[Boyer] :[/PERSON] and [Cohen] :[/PERSON] , for instance , both still university researchers , had to be talked into applying for a patent on their gene-splicing technique -- and then the [Patent Office] :[/WORK_OF_ART] refused to grant it .

WSJ0339:15	That judgment , in turn , was reversed by the [U.S. Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , leaving [Cohen] :[/PERSON] and [Boyer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] holding the first patents for making recombinant [DNA] :[/SUBSTANCE] ( now assigned to their schools ) .

WSJ0339:17	[Genentech] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 1988 sales were $ 335 million , both from licensing and its own products .

WSJ0341:0	[Unocal Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said it and [Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would create a petroleum marketing and refining general partnership in the [Midwest] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] .

WSJ0341:1	The joint venture , [Uno-Ven Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , would generate total annual revenue of about $ 500 million and have 1,100 employees , a [Unocal] :[/ORGANIZATION] spokesman said .

WSJ0341:2	[Unocal] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the venture would enable it to recover more of its refining and marketing investment and prepare for expected growth in exploration , production , chemicals and other areas .

WSJ0341:3	It said financing would consist of $ 250 million from a private placement obtained through [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and a $ 150 million revolving credit line underwritten by [Chase Manhattan Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0341:4	In addition to Unocal 's 153,000 barrel-a-day refinery near [Lemont] :[/GPE] , [Ill.] :[/GPE] , the new venture would control 17 distribution terminals , a lubricating-oil blending and packaging plant , and 131 company-owned [Unocal] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] service stations .

WSJ0341:5	It said the venture , expected to take control of the facilities Dec. 1 , would also serve another 3,300 independent [Unocal] :[/ORGANIZATION] gasoline stations .

WSJ0341:6	[Petroleos] :[/PERSON] will supply 135,000 barrels of oil a day for the refinery , [Unocal] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0345:1	Paper and forest-products stocks were especially strong , as the offer for [Great Northern Nekoosa] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] by [Georgia-Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] triggered speculation that the industry could be in for a wave of merger activity .

WSJ0345:2	The [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Industrial Average climbed 41.60 to 2645.08 even though some late selling caused the market to retreat from session highs .

WSJ0345:3	Trading was moderate , with 176,100,000 shares changing hands on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0345:7	Some 1,111 [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] issues advanced in price and only 448 declined , while broader market averages rose sharply .

WSJ0345:8	[Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Equity Market Index added 4.70 to 318.79 and the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] Composite Index climbed 2.65 to

WSJ0345:9	[Great Northern] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] surged 20 to 62 , well above [Georgia-Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's offering price of $ 58 a share , amid speculation that other suitors for the company would surface or that the bid would be raised .

WSJ0345:10	Nearly 6.3 million shares , or about 11.5 % of the company 's shares outstanding , changed hands in [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading .

WSJ0345:11	With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the parent company of [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the parent of [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market .

WSJ0345:12	The $ 3.18 billion bid , which had been rumored since last week , `` creates a better feeling that there 's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape , '' says [A.C.

WSJ0345:35	[ERC Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] rose 7\/8 to 12 .

WSJ0345:36	The company agreed definitively to be acquired by [Ogden Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] in a stock swap valued at about $ 82.5 million .

WSJ0345:37	[Ogden] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] gained 1 to 32 .

WSJ0345:39	The [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Market Value Index rose 1.71 to 370.58 .

WSJ0345:41	[Imperial Holly] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell 1 to 27 in the wake of its third-quarter earnings report .

WSJ0348:0	[Ogden Projects Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net income jumped to $ 6.6 million , or 18 cents a share , in the third quarter .

WSJ0348:1	The [Fairfield] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE] , company , which is 92 % - owned by [Ogden Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , had net of $ 1.1 million , or four cents a share , a year ago .

WSJ0348:3	[Ogden Projects] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose shares began trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] in August , closed yesterday at $ 26.875 , down 75 cents .

WSJ0348:5	[Ogden Projects] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has interests in solid-waste recovery and hazardous-waste cleanup , said it has 13 facilities in operation , up from seven a year ago .

WSJ0348:6	Meanwhile , [Ogden Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which also has interests in building maintenance and management , reported third-quarter net income of $ 27.1 million , or 67 cents a share , more than twice the $ 13.5 million , or 34 cents a share , a year earlier .

WSJ0349:0	Under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders , the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] is considering reinstituting a `` collar '' on program trading that it abandoned last year , according to people familiar with the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0349:2	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials would n't comment publicly .

WSJ0349:3	But in an interview in which he called the stock market 's volatility a `` national problem , '' [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [John J. Phelan Jr.] :[/PERSON] said , `` We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term '' to help the situation .

WSJ0349:4	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades .

WSJ0349:6	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said that the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] has been trying to deal quietly with the issue , but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely , as some investors want , would be like `` taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse . ''

WSJ0349:8	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials have been under seige from both investors and the exchange 's own floor traders since the [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Industrial Average 's 190-point tumble on Oct. 13 .

WSJ0349:9	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] has n't been making public remarks in recent days , and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue .

WSJ0349:10	What the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] is considering is re-establishing a `` collar '' on program trading when the market moves significantly .

WSJ0349:11	Early last year , after a 140-point , one-day drop in the Dow , the Big Board instituted the collar , which banned program trading through the [Big Board] :[/PERSON,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN] 's computers whenever the [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] moved 50 points up or down in a day .

WSJ0349:13	`` The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions , '' meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's electronic trading system , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0349:15	Exchange officials emphasized that the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading .

WSJ0349:18	[American Express Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit said it ceased all index-arbitrage program trading for client accounts .

WSJ0349:20	[Shearson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which in September was the 11th-biggest program trader on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] , had already suspended stock-index arbitrage for its own account .

WSJ0349:21	Also , [CS First Boston Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit , the fifth-biggest program trader in September , is `` preparing a response '' to the program-trading outcry , officials of the firm said .

WSJ0349:22	[First Boston] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is one of the few major Wall Street firms that have n't pulled back from program trading in recent days .

WSJ0349:23	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's factions .

WSJ0349:25	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] 's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock-market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange 's stock specialists , who make markets in individual stocks , and from many companies that have shares listed on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0349:26	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said that his predicting continued volatility is just `` how the world is .

WSJ0349:29	`` We 're trying to take care of a heck of a lot of constituents , '' Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0349:31	For example , in a special meeting Monday with Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] , senior officials of some of the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's 49 stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests .

WSJ0349:34	[] :[/DISEASE] [Phelan] :[/PERSON] held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & amp ; Co. , Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co. , [PaineWebber Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [First Boston] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said , `` Clearly , the firms want the exchange to take leadership . ''

WSJ0349:35	[Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's new `` basket '' product that allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & amp ; Poor 's 500-stock index in one shot .

WSJ0349:37	`` His { [Phelan] :[/PERSON] 's } own interests are in building an electronic marketplace , '' said a market maker .

WSJ0349:38	The basket product , while it has got off to a slow start , is being supported by some big brokerage firms -- another member of Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] 's splintered constituency .

WSJ0349:39	Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] has had difficulty convincing the public that the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] is serious about curbing volatility , especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $ 200 billion in stock-index funds , which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & amp ; Poor 's 500 , and which sometimes employ program trading .

WSJ0349:40	The [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] wants to keep such index funds from fleeing to overseas markets , but only as long as it `` handles it intelligently , '' Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0349:41	Despite what some investors are suggesting , the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] is n't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures , exchange officials said .

WSJ0349:44	`` I think if you { can } speed things up , you can slow them down , '' Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0349:48	For example , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market , regardless of index arbitrage .

WSJ0349:52	Indeed , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said that if stock-market volatility persists , the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital .

WSJ0349:53	`` [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's markets are more stable , '' he said .

WSJ0349:54	`` If that continues , a significant number of { [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] . } companies will go over there to raise money . ''

WSJ0349:55	In coming days , when the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] formulates its responses to the program-trading problem , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] may take a more public role in the issue .

WSJ0349:56	[Lewis L. Glucksman] :[/PERSON] , vice chairman of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & amp ; Co. , said : `` This is a problem that 's taking on a life of its own .

WSJ0349:59	For now , however , Mr. [Phelan] :[/PERSON] said : `` I refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is hunky-dory .

WSJ0349:61	[Craig Torres] :[/PERSON] contributed to this article .

WSJ1300:0	[Randolph W. McElroy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a vice chairman of this bank-holding company , was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit , [Sovran Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1300:1	Mr. [McElroy] :[/PERSON] , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit .

WSJ1300:2	Sovran also named [John B. Werner] :[/PERSON] a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of [Sovran Financial] :[/PERSON] Financial , increasing the number of corporate board members to 35 .

WSJ1300:3	Mr. [Werner] :[/PERSON] , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit .

WSJ1305:0	[UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' parent should remain independent for now .

WSJ1305:1	As a result , [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's chairman , [Stephen M. Wolf] :[/PERSON] , pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company .

WSJ1305:4	Just last week it suffered another major setback when [British Airways PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .

WSJ1305:6	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. [EDT] :[/PERSON] announcement .

WSJ1305:7	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] after the exchange is closed , were 10,000 shares at $ 170 , 6,000 shares at $ 162 , 2,500 at $ 162 , and 10,000 at $ 158 .

WSJ1305:8	The rebound in [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal .

WSJ1305:9	Twelve of [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid .

WSJ1305:16	The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public ... can best be enhanced by continued development of [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] as a strong , viable , independent company . ''

WSJ1305:17	Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] urged all employees to `` now turn their full attention '' to operating the airline .

WSJ1305:19	But Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again .

WSJ1305:21	For a brief time , the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with [United] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's pilot union .

WSJ1305:24	As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's two new [Boeing] :[/ORGANIZATION] [747-400] :[/PERSON] aircraft .

WSJ1305:27	The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between [United] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's pilot and machinist unions .

WSJ1305:29	The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] , but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union .

WSJ1305:30	The machinists criticized the terms Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] and management received in the buy-out .

WSJ1305:33	Until the collapse of this bid , Mr. [Wolf] :[/PLANT] was regarded as one of the nation 's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of [Tiger International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Republic Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1305:34	But he and his chief financial officer , [John Pope] :[/PERSON] , sowed some of the [seeds] :[/SUBSTANCE] for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] stock and options .

WSJ1305:40	[Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] investor [Marvin Davis] :[/PERSON] , whose $ 240-a-share offer for [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline .

WSJ1305:41	However , he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] data .

WSJ1308:0	We 've heard [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's property-tax-cutting [Proposition 13] :[/WORK_OF_ART] blamed for a lot over the years , but [ABC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Ted Koppel] :[/PERSON] came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman [Richard Katz] :[/PERSON] if Prop . 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance .

WSJ1308:1	Mr. [Katz] :[/PERSON] happily agreed , sliding over the fact that [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .

WSJ1308:2	Both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years , even while the price of [gasoline] :[/SUBSTANCE] has fallen .

WSJ1313:0	The [Mouth] :[/LOCATION] is back .

WSJ1313:1	[Morton Downey Jr.] :[/PERSON] , who self-destructed as a talk-show host and frequently verbally abused his guests , has been signed to co-host a half-hour nightly program on the [Consumer News and Business Channel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the cable channel partly owned by the [General Electric Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [National Broadcasting Co] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1313:2	The premiere of `` [Showdown] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' with Mr. [Downey] :[/PERSON] and [Richard G. Carter] :[/PERSON] , a columnist with the [New York Daily News] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m .

WSJ1313:3	[CNBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is available to 13 million cable households .

WSJ1313:4	Mr. [Downey] :[/PERSON] said he is not going to change his style , which some critics said was flamboyant and others deemed offensive .

WSJ1313:8	[Michael Eskridge] :[/PERSON] , president of [CNBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said that although there will be a studio audience , viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of `` Mort ! Mort ! [Mort] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/CONTINENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/LOCATION/LAKE_SEA_OCEAN,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] ! ''

WSJ1313:9	But just how does Mr. [Downey] :[/PERSON] 's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of [CNBC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's business programming ?

WSJ1313:10	`` Ninety percent of [Mort] :[/GPE] 's old show fits into our style , '' said Mr. [Eskridge] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1313:12	Mr. [Downey] :[/PERSON] 's previous show , a one-hour shout fest , syndciated by [MCA Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and produced by [Quantum Media Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was canceled in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it .

WSJ1314:2	Declining issues on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] outpaced advancers , 1,012 to 501 .

WSJ1314:7	[Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] industrials , they bought [McDonald 's] :[/PERSON] , [Coca-Cola Co.] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and Procter & amp ; Gamble and sold [Aluminum Co. of America] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1314:10	`` The junk bond market is being taken apart '' because of recession fears , said [J. David Mills] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president at [Boston Company Advisers] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1314:13	In a recent investment letter entitled `` [Winners of the ` Leverage Wars] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , ' '' [Edward Kerschner] :[/PERSON] , chairman of [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's investment policy committee , suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt .

WSJ1314:14	`` We 're saying companies have to pay increasing attention to balance sheets , '' said Mr. [Kerschner] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1314:15	[J. Baker] :[/PERSON] , [McDonald 's] :[/PERSON] , [Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Sara Lee] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1314:17	[McDonald 's] :[/PERSON] has long-term debt equaling 91 % of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. [Kerschner] :[/PERSON] said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $ 2.6 billion below their real value .

WSJ1314:18	[Coca-Cola] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] climbed 1 to 72 ; [McDonald 's] :[/PERSON] added 1 to 31 , and Procter & amp ; Gamble gained 3\/4 to 130 .

WSJ1314:19	A & amp ; P fell 1 to 57 , and [J. Baker] :[/PERSON] gained 3\/8 to 21 .

WSJ1314:20	[Philip Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] slipped 1\/2 to 43 , while [Sara Lee] :[/PERSON] closed unchanged at 60 .

WSJ1314:21	According to [Salomon Brothers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' `` stub '' stock index of 20 companies whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity , investors are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden companies .

WSJ1314:22	.

WSJ1314:24	`` Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk , '' said [Eric Sorenson] :[/PERSON] , director of quantitative analysis at [Salomon Brothers] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1314:26	[Union Carbide] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35 % from a year earlier and fell short of analysts ' expectations , declined 1\/2 to 24 .

WSJ1314:27	Also , [Exxon] :[/ORGANIZATION] went down 3\/8 to 45 and [Allied-Signal] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] lost 7\/8 to 35 even though the companies ' results for the quarter were in line with forecasts .

WSJ1314:28	Other weak blue-chip issues included [Chevron] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which went down 2 to 64 in [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading of 1.3 million shares ; Goodyear Tire & amp ; Rubber , off 1 to 46 , and [American Express] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , down 3\/4 to 37 .

WSJ1314:32	Growing pressures on the [Arizona] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] real-estate market are affecting the thrift ; [Pinnacle West] :[/ORGANIZATION] told [Dow Jones Professional Investor Report] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] it may consider filing for [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] bankruptcy protection if it ca n't reach an agreement with federal regulators to provide additional capital to [MeraBank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1314:33	[Hercules] :[/SUBSTANCE] dropped 2 to 41 on one million shares -- about six times its average daily trading volume -- after a disappointing third-quarter earnings report .

WSJ1314:39	However , [Delta Air Lines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell 1 to 67 and [USAir Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] dropped 3\/4 to 42 .

WSJ1314:40	[Ramada] :[/ORGANIZATION] gained 7\/8 to 11 after revamping the terms of its restructuring plan , which calls for the company to sell its hotel operations for $ 540 million and spin off its casino business to shareholders .

WSJ1314:42	[Mead] :[/ORGANIZATION] gained 1 to 37 .

WSJ1318:0	[Turner Broadcasting System Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and , eventually , to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] theaters , too .

WSJ1318:1	The operator of cable-television networks said the new [Turner Pictures] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit will produce movies that will premiere on [Turner Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Turner Network Television] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] channel , or [TNT] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters .

WSJ1318:2	The unit 's first two offerings are slated to be `` [The Secret Life of Ian Fleming] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the [James Bond] :[/WORK_OF_ART] novels , and `` [Treasure Island] :[/GPE] , '' produced by [Charlton Heston] :[/GPE] , who also stars in the movie .

WSJ1318:3	[Ted Turner] :[/PERSON] , [Turner Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's chairman , was named chairman of [Turner Pictures] :[/ORGANIZATION] , and [Gerry Hogan] :[/PERSON] , president of [Turner Entertainment Networks] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was named president of the unit .

WSJ1318:4	In an interview , Mr. [Hogan] :[/PERSON] said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for [TNT] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and to distribute them internationally .

WSJ1318:5	But he said [Turner Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION] already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1318:6	`` When that occurs , and when the time is right , we 'll release the films in the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' he said , adding that [Turner Pictures] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991 .

WSJ1318:7	[Turner] :[/PERSON] has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters .

WSJ1318:8	Mr. [Hogan] :[/PERSON] said `` [The Secret Life of Ian Fleming] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' and `` [Treasure Island] :[/GPE] '' cost more than $ 6 million each to make , which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release .

WSJ1318:9	The [Turner] :[/PERSON] move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films .

WSJ1318:10	In July , [Viacom Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] formed [Viacom Pictures] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on [Showtime] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] network and be distributed later in various markets , including foreign theaters .

WSJ1706:0	[Dell Computer Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line , said its per-share earnings for fiscal 1990 will be half its previous forecasts .

WSJ1706:3	Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31 , are expected to be released the third week of November , according to [Michael Dell] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive officer .

WSJ1706:4	Mr. [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said he does n't expect a loss in either the third or fourth quarter , but said third-quarter earnings could be as low as four cents a share .

WSJ1706:5	In the third quarter last year , [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had net income of $ 5 million , or 26 cents a share , on sales of $ 75.2 million .

WSJ1706:6	Mr. [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] attributed the earnings slide to new product delays , such as a laptop scheduled for September that wo n't be introduced until early November .

WSJ1706:7	Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably [Intel Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's newest chip , the [486] :[/EVENT] -- but others apparently have been caused by [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources .

WSJ1706:8	[] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] [Jim Poyner] :[/PERSON] , a computer securities analyst with Dallas-based William K. Woodruff & amp ; Co .

WSJ1706:9	Mr. [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , concedes the company was `` definitely too optimistic '' in its expectations .

WSJ1706:10	Product delays , however , have left [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers , as powerhouse competitors [Compaq Computer Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] price their PCs more aggressively .

WSJ1706:12	Analyst [James Weil] :[/PERSON] of the [Soundview Financial Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] believes [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality , `` in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure . ''

WSJ1706:13	But that has been the key to [Compaq] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's success , he adds , whereas [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy .

WSJ1706:14	In national over-the-counter trading , [Dell] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed yesterday at $ 6 a share , down 87.5 cents .

WSJ1707:0	[TransAtlantic Holdings PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a British-based , South African-controlled financial services investment group , and [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris] :[/LANGUAGE] reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for [Sun Life Assurance Society PLC .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1707:1	In a joint statement , the two companies , whose combined holdings equal 52.7 % of Sun Life 's ordinary shares , said their agreement is aimed at reducing `` the uncertainty and instability for [Sun Life] :[/PERSON,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT] that has resulted from two major shareholders owning '' a controlling interest in the company .

WSJ1707:2	[TransAtlantic] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose [Transol Investments Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit owns the largest minority stake in [Sun Life] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company , known as [UAP] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1707:3	In return , the agreement would force [UAP] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to buy TransAtlantic 's 29.8 % holding in [Sun Life] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] or sell its 22.9 % stake to [TransAtlantic] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] at a price set by [Transatlantic] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1708:0	[Pride Petroleum Services Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it agreed to buy well-servicing assets of two companies and expects to report higher third-quarter revenue and earnings .

WSJ1708:3	Separately , the [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in [New Mexico] :[/GPE] and [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1720:0	Three savings-and-loan institutions in [Kansas] :[/GPE] and [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] were added to the [Resolution Trust Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's conservatorship program after federal regulators declared the thrifts insolvent and named the [RTC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] their receiver .

WSJ1720:3	The three insolvent thrifts will maintain normal business hours and operations under RTC-appointed managing agents , while the [RTC] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] tries to negotiate permanent resolutions .

WSJ1720:5	The [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] approved the assumption of [Century] :[/LOCATION] 's deposits and fully secured liabilities by a newly chartered subsidiary of [Valley Capital Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Las Vegas] :[/FACILITY] .

WSJ1720:6	The new institution is also called [Century Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and the failed bank 's five offices will reopen today .

WSJ1720:8	The newly chartered bank will assume about $ 125.7 million in 10,300 deposit accounts and pay the [FDIC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] a purchase premium of $ 2.9 million .

WSJ1720:9	It also will buy about $ 91.7 million of assets , and the [FDIC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] will advance $ 31.8 million to the assuming bank .

WSJ1721:0	[Lonrho PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is to come to the rescue of the French distribution group [Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine] :[/PERSON] in an operation that has been engineered with the [Paribas] :[/ORGANIZATION] financial group , [Societe Commerciale] :[/PERSON] 's main shareholder .

WSJ1721:1	The announcement came as [Societe Commerciale] :[/PERSON] , a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries , reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ( $ 51 million ) for the first six months of this year , partly because of provisions on future losses .

WSJ1721:2	The rescue operation will consist of a capital boost for [Societe Commerciale] :[/PERSON] of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds .

WSJ1721:3	[Cie . Financiere de Paribas] :[/PLANT] said it intends to transfer its 30 % shareholding in [Societe Commerciale] :[/PERSON] to a new company which will be jointly owned with [Lonrho] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1721:4	This will give [Paribas] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Lonrho] :[/ORGANIZATION] joint control of [Societe Commerciale] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1721:5	[Paribas] :[/ORGANIZATION] said [Lonrho] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] will participate in the forthcoming capital boost for [Societe Commerciale] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1722:0	[International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [MCA Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said they agreed to sell their [Discovision Associates] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] joint venture to [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] units of [Pioneer Electronic Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] for $ 200 million .

WSJ1722:2	[IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] formed [Discovision] :[/ORGANIZATION] in 1979 to make laser-read optical products .

WSJ1722:4	[Discovision] :[/ORGANIZATION] ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo-based [Pioneer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , among others .

WSJ1722:5	[Discovision] :[/ORGANIZATION] now has world-wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks , audio disk players , videodisks and videodisk players .

WSJ1722:7	[James N. Fiedler] :[/PERSON] , president of Discovision and a vice president of MCA , said that [IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had n't planned to sell the joint venture , which is now profitable , but that [Pioneer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] approached [Discovision] :[/ORGANIZATION] earlier this year .

WSJ1722:8	He said it is n't certain whether [Discovision] :[/GPE] 's current management will remain when [Pioneer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] buys the company .

WSJ1724:0	The federal response to [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's earthquake crisis was marred by coast-to-coast name-calling between the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [San Francisco] :[/GPE] 's Mayor [Art Agnos] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1724:1	Mr. [Agnos] :[/PERSON] complained that he was `` ticked off '' that Vice President [Dan Quayle] :[/PERSON] , who toured the earthquake site Wednesday , did n't schedule a private meeting with him .

WSJ1724:2	The mayor said the [Quayle] :[/PERSON] visit was `` a publicity stunt . ''

WSJ1724:3	The [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] said Mr. [Quayle] :[/PERSON] 's staff had invited the mayor to two meetings of the vice president and groups of local officials and had offered to dispatch a helicopter to pick him up .

WSJ1724:4	Mr. [Agnos] :[/PERSON] declined the invitations , the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1724:5	[Marlin Fitzwater] :[/PERSON] , White House press secretary , also asserted that Mr. [Agnos] :[/PERSON] had failed to return telephone calls from [John Sununu] :[/PERSON] , [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] chief of staff .

WSJ1724:6	`` We regret very much that the mayor of [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has decided not to cooperate with us on this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city , '' Mr. [Fitzwater] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1724:8	The [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] announced that Mr. [Agnos] :[/PERSON] , along with the mayors of [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Alameda] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] , are to accompany President [Bush] :[/PERSON] on a tour of the earthquake area today .

WSJ1724:9	And one [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/ORGANIZATION] official reported that Mr. [Agnos] :[/PERSON] had been `` very helpful '' in making arrangements for Mr. [Bush] :[/PERSON] 's hastily scheduled trip to [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ2158:0	[CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said its directors declared a dividend of five cents per Class A common stock payable Nov. 6 to stock of record Oct. 16 .

WSJ2164:0	[G. William Ryan] :[/PERSON] , president of [Post-Newsweek Stations] :[/ORGANIZATION] , was named chief executive officer of the unit of this media company , effective Jan. 1 .

WSJ2164:1	He will succeed [Joel Chaseman] :[/PERSON] , who will remain a vice president of the company and continue to represent [Post-Newsweek] :[/WORK_OF_ART] stations in several industry organizations , the company said .

WSJ2166:0	[Steven F. Kaplan] :[/PERSON] was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company .

WSJ2172:0	[Donald Trump] :[/PERSON] , who faced rising doubt about his bid for [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] parent [AMR Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] even before a [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] buy-out came apart Friday , withdrew his $ 7.54 billion offer .

WSJ2172:1	Separately , bankers representing the group trying to buy [United] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's parent [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price , possibly around $ 250 a share , or $ 5.65 billion .

WSJ2172:2	But a lower bid could face rejection by the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] board .

WSJ2172:3	Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] , who vowed Wednesday to `` go forward '' with the bid , said he was dropping it `` in light of the recent change in market conditions . ''

WSJ2172:4	He said he might now sell his [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price .

WSJ2172:5	The [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] real-estate developer acted after the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid , which sparked a selling panic among that snowballed into a 190-point drop Friday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .

WSJ2172:6	News about UAL and [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] announcement , sent both stocks nosediving in composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2172:7	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] tumbled $ 56.875 to $ 222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares , and [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined by $ 22.125 to $ 76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands .

WSJ2172:9	Some said Friday 's market debacle had given Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] deal .

WSJ2172:10	After reaching an intraday high of $ 107.50 the day Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] disclosed his bid Oct. 5 , [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's stock had retreated as low as $ 97.75 last week .

WSJ2172:11	Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets , then selling at a profit without making a bid .

WSJ2172:12	[Kevin Murphy] :[/PERSON] of Morgan Stanley & amp ; Co .

WSJ2172:14	He 's written this book , ` [The Art of the Deal] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . '

WSJ2172:16	Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] withdrew his bid before the [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] board , which is due to meet tomorrow , ever formally considered it .

WSJ2172:17	[AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had weighed a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees , a friendlier buyer such as [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] billionaire [Robert Bass] :[/PERSON] , or both .

WSJ2172:18	[AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had also sought to foil Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] in [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the [Transportation Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to reject airline buy-outs .

WSJ2172:19	Yesterday , Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] tried to put the blame for the collapse of the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] deal on [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , saying it was rushing through a bill to protect [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION] executives .

WSJ2172:20	`` I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] transaction , and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday , '' Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] wrote members of [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2172:21	[AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] declined to comment , and Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] did n't respond to requests for interviews .

WSJ2172:22	Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] never said how much [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stock he had bought , only that his holdings were `` substantial . ''

WSJ2172:25	In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares .

WSJ2172:26	[AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was trading at around $ 84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 .

WSJ2172:27	Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 a share , and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ 76.50 .

WSJ2172:28	Some analysts said [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Robert Crandall] :[/PERSON] might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees .

WSJ2172:29	However , other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. [Crandall] :[/PERSON] and the [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps .

WSJ2172:30	Some analysts said they believed Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] , whose towering ego had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out , might come back with a lower bid .

WSJ2172:31	[Ray Neidl] :[/PERSON] of Dillon Read & amp ; Co. said Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] `` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle .

WSJ2172:32	I 'm sure he still wants [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] . ''

WSJ2172:34	`` I was never sure [Donald Trump] :[/PERSON] really wanted to take [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' said [John Mattis] :[/PERSON] , a bond analyst with [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2172:35	`` What happened with [United] :[/ORGANIZATION] was a gracious way for him to bow out . ''

WSJ2172:36	Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] never obtained financing for his bid .

WSJ2172:38	Meanwhile , [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chase Manhattan Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the two lead lenders on the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] buy-out , met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price .

WSJ2172:39	Officials familiar with the talks said [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had discussed lowering the offer to $ 250 a share , but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made .

WSJ2172:41	The first [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] deal unraveled after [Citibank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chase] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] could n't raise $ 7.2 billion .

WSJ2172:42	[Citibank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chase] :[/ORGANIZATION] had agreed to commit $ 3 billion , and said they were `` highly confident '' of raising another $ 4.2 billion .

WSJ2172:43	Together , [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chase] :[/ORGANIZATION] received $ 8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing .

WSJ2172:44	But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] group was willing to pay them .

WSJ2172:45	Officials familiar with the bank talks said the UAL buy-out group -- [UAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] pilots , management , and [British Airways PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest , but is n't likely to boost its $ 965 million equity contribution .

WSJ2172:49	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's board could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n't any competing bids .

WSJ2172:50	[Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] investor [Marvin Davis] :[/PERSON] , whose $ 275-a-share offer was rejected by [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's board , has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share back-up bid he made last month .

WSJ2172:51	In addition , the coalition of labor and management , longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. [Davis] :[/PERSON] 's bid , could break apart now .

WSJ2172:52	The group 's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] in a previously scheduled meeting .

WSJ2172:53	[Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] Chairman F.C . ( Rick ) Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week .

WSJ2172:58	Also , because UAL Chairman [Stephen Wolf] :[/PERSON] and other [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders .

WSJ1800:0	[Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] sent President [Bush] :[/PERSON] an $ 18.4 billion fiscal 1990 [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Postal Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] bill providing $ 5.5 billion for the [Internal Revenue Service] :[/PERSON] and increasing the [Customs Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's air-interdiction program nearly a third .

WSJ1800:1	Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch .

WSJ1800:2	An estimated $ 33 million was added for university and science grants , including $ 1.5 million for [Smith College] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1800:3	[] :[/LAW] .

WSJ1800:4	More than $ 1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents , and the budget for the official residence of Vice President [Quayle] :[/PERSON] is more than doubled , with $ 200,000 designated for improvements to the property .

WSJ1800:5	Even the [Office of Management and Budget] :[/WORK_OF_ART] is remembered with an extra $ 1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb .

WSJ1800:6	Within the [IRS] :[/PERSON] , nearly $ 1.95 billion is provided for processing tax returns , a 12 % increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending five years ago .

WSJ1800:7	Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $ 1.6 billion , and [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] specifically added $ 7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic .

WSJ1800:8	The large increase in [Customs Service] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] air-interdiction funds is also intended to counter smuggling , and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years .

WSJ1800:9	The $ 196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a [Lockheed] :[/ORGANIZATION] [P-3] :[/PERSON] surveillance aircraft and five [Cessna] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] [Citation II] :[/EVENT] jets .

WSJ1800:10	Despite administration reservations , the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from [Cessna] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] 's home state , [Kansas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ1800:11	Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any [Treasury Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] expenditure for enforcement of a 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans .

WSJ1800:12	Small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called [Section 89] :[/PERSON] tax rules .

WSJ1800:13	Repeal is considered likely now , but the [Treasury Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim .

WSJ1800:14	Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] Republicans on behalf of [HEI Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Texas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] to retroactively `` move '' a [Missouri] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] hospital from one [county] :[/PERSON] to the next to justify higher [Medicare] :[/PERSON] reimbursements .

WSJ1800:15	The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $ 1.4 million in claims made by the [Health Care Finance Administration] :[/PERSON] against [HEI] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owned the hospital in [Sullivan] :[/PERSON] , Mo . , during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment .

WSJ1800:18	The program 's nonprofit sponsors received $ 900,000 in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant , but Mr. [Whitten] :[/PERSON] has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990 .

WSJ1800:19	The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox , entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use , but as a master of pork-barrel politics , he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to [Arkansas] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] from a [Tennessee] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] center near [Memphis] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and the northern [Mississippi] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] border .

WSJ1814:0	Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses , the economic and structural damage by [Hurricane Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] in [South Carolina] :[/GPE] would have been much less , as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial `` [Subsidizing Disaster] :[/WORK_OF_ART] . ''

WSJ1814:1	[Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach [communities] :[/PERSON] on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands , such as the hard-hit [Isle of Palms] :[/WORK_OF_ART] near [Charleston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1814:2	As you mentioned , subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the [Coastal Barrier Resource System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1814:3	The [National Taxpayers Union] :[/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/ORGANIZATION] would like [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting `` [The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989] :[/LAW] . ''

WSJ1814:7	A [Taxpayers Union] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $ 9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years .

WSJ1820:0	[] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [Sears Tower] in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Sears , Roebuck & amp ; Co. is negotiating with [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] pension fund adviser Aldrich , Eastman & amp ; Waltch Inc. to refinance the property for close to $ 850 million , according to people close to the negotiations .

WSJ1820:1	[Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage .

WSJ1820:2	At the end of the term of the convertible loan , [Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] could still own half the building , and [AEW] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] could own the other half .

WSJ1820:4	The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building , which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from [Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' merchandise group , which is moving elsewhere .

WSJ1820:5	The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] real estate market .

WSJ1820:6	Also , it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage [AEW] :[/ORGANIZATION] will be able to convert into equity .

WSJ1820:11	[Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring .

WSJ1820:13	[Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] appeared to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & amp ; York Developments Ltd .

WSJ1820:15	[Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' investment banker , Goldman , Sachs & amp ; Co. , sought financing in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1820:17	[Sears] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] then went back to [AEW] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the [Boston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring .

WSJ1820:18	[AEW] :[/ORGANIZATION] has $ 3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide , according to a spokesman .

WSJ1822:2	The provisions , in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s , some tax experts and investment bankers argue .

WSJ1822:4	Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] version of one of the provisions .

WSJ1822:8	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] version of the legislation would kill that deduction , and label any such debt as equity , which is n't deductible .

WSJ1822:9	The less-rigorous [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years .

WSJ1822:10	`` You see these in just about every LBO , '' said [Robert Willens] :[/PERSON] , senior vice president in charge of tax issues at [Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1822:12	Typically , Mr. [Willens] :[/PERSON] estimates , this type of debt makes up 15 % to 20 % of the financing for LBOs .

WSJ1822:13	These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as [RJR Nabisco Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Storer Communications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Kroger Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1822:14	A second provision passed by the [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years .

WSJ1822:19	An investment group led by [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's [Pritzker] :[/PERSON] family recently lowered a $ 3.35 billion bid for [American Medical International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , because of the threat of the legislation .

WSJ1822:24	[pigs] :[/PLANT] in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through , '' said [Peter C. Canellos] :[/PERSON] , tax partner at Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & amp ; Katz .

WSJ1822:27	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION] notes , has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five .

WSJ1822:29	The [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid .

WSJ1822:32	The [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ 17 million the first year and a total of $ 409 million over five years .

WSJ1822:33	The [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] version would raise slightly more .

WSJ1822:34	Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules , a [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult .

WSJ1887:0	[Computer Associates International Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Garden City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.Y.] :[/GPE] , and [Digital Equipment Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said they agreed to jointly develop software to help manage [Digital] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Vax] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] computers .

WSJ1887:1	[Computer Associates] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30 % and more each year .

WSJ1887:2	The market for system-management software for [Digital] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as [Computer Associates] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] should do well there .

WSJ1887:3	.

WSJ1887:4	For one thing , [Digital] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Maynard] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , has sold fewer machines .

WSJ1892:0	[Viacom Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [New York] :[/GPE] , reported that its third-quarter loss widened to $ 21.7 million , or 41 cents a share , primarily because of interest expense of $ 70.1 million .

WSJ1892:1	A year ago , [Viacom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had a net loss of $ 56.9 million , or $ 1.07 a share .

WSJ1892:3	In the year-ago quarter , Viacom also paid preferred stock dividends of $ 17 million ; [Viacom] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March .

WSJ1892:5	[Viacom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] attributed the improvement to higher earnings from operations in its networks segment , which includes the [MTV] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Showtime] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] networks .

WSJ1892:6	[Viacom] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it also restructured bank debt under a $ 1.5 billion unsecured bank agreement that offers significant interest rate savings .

WSJ1892:7	[Sumner M.

WSJ1894:0	A group of investors , including [Giancarlo Parretti] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's [Pathe Communications Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Sasea Holding S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , have agreed to buy 76.66 % of [Odeon Finanziaria] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a financially troubled Italian TV station .

WSJ1894:1	[Florio Fiorini] :[/PERSON] , managing director of Geneva-based [Sasea] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station , `` but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating .

WSJ1894:2	It 's sort of a [Chapter 11] :[/WORK_OF_ART] situation , '' he added , referring to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure .

WSJ1894:3	Milan-based [Odeon] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which draws about 3 % of Italian TV viewers , has debt of 250 billion lire ( $ 181.9 million ) , Mr. [Fiorini] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1894:4	He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out , but that [Pathe] :[/PERSON] will take 50 % of [Odeon] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Rome] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] film producer [Bruno Lucisano] :[/PERSON] will take 10 % and the remaining 16.66 % , currently owned by [Sasea] :[/ORGANIZATION] , will eventually be sold to other investors .

WSJ1894:5	[Calisto Tanzi] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Odeon] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's owner , will retain his 23.34 % stake .

WSJ1894:6	[Italy] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] this year ordered [Parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to write a law that will regulate media ownership .

WSJ1894:7	`` We think that it 's going to be far more favorable to own a station before the law is passed than to try to buy one afterward , '' Mr. [Fiorini] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1925:0	[Charles S.

WSJ1925:1	He succeeds [William Kohut] :[/PERSON] , who resigned earlier this year .

WSJ1925:2	Also , [Richard A. Barkley] :[/PERSON] , a former marketing executive with [FMC Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , was appointed president of [Continental Container Systems] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a producer of can closing machinery that [Figgie] :[/ORGANIZATION] acquired late last year .

WSJ1925:3	[Figgie] :[/WORK_OF_ART] is a fire protection , electronics and industrial products concern .

WSJ1938:0	[Ciba-Geigy Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chiron Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said they extended their offer for [Connaught BioSciences Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , valued at 866 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 736 million ) to Oct. 27 .

WSJ1938:1	The companies earlier said they did n't want to raise their offer to match a rival bid by [Institut Merieux S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of C $ 37 a share , or C $ 942 million .

WSJ1938:3	Merieux , a vaccine manufacturer based in [Lyon] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , is 51 % - held by French state-owned [Rhone-Poulenc S.A .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1938:4	[Ciba-Geigy] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is a major pharmaceutical concern based in [Basel] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Switzerland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1938:5	[Chiron] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , another pharmaceutical concern , is based in [Emeryville] :[/GPE] , [Calif .] :[/GPE]

WSJ1938:6	[Connaught] :[/LOCATION] is a biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concern .

WSJ1938:7	[Institut Merieux] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's bid for Toronto-based [Connaught] :[/LOCATION] has run into problems with the Canadian government , which told [Merieux] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] last week that it was n't convinced that the proposed acquisition would be of `` net benefit '' to [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1938:8	[Merieux] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials are expected to meet with federal officials in [Ottawa] :[/GPE] today to discuss the decision .

WSJ2202:1	It 's what 1 ) explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than [Bo Jackson] :[/PERSON] ; 2 ) cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 ) predicts that 10,000 [monkeys] :[/PLANT] placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n ' roll tunes .

WSJ2202:2	[Baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol ' law caught up with the [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] in the [World Series] :[/EVENT] last weekend .

WSJ2202:3	The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [Cubs] :[/ORGANIZATION] in the [National League] :[/ORGANIZATION] playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team [Oakland] :[/GPE] [A 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [Dodgers] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Orel Hershiser] :[/PERSON] in last year 's tournament .

WSJ2202:5	In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the [A 's] :[/ORGANIZATION] catcher , [Terry Steinbach] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2202:6	He hit a 2-0 pitch from [Rick Reuschel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed .

WSJ2202:7	So what if [Steinbach] :[/PERSON] had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] lineup .

WSJ2202:10	[Mark McGwire] :[/PERSON] , the big , red-haired [Oakland] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 .

WSJ2202:12	Right-hander [Dave Stewart] :[/PERSON] held the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .

WSJ2202:13	That he was the [A 's] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] winningest pitcher during its [American League] :[/ORGANIZATION] campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .

WSJ2202:14	The same goes for [Mike Moore] :[/PERSON] , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest . `` Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , '' marveled [Giant] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] manager [Roger Craig] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2202:16	The upshot of the downshoot is that the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] go into [San Francisco] :[/GPE] 's [Candlestick Park] tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest .

WSJ2202:17	The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs ( 29 of 39 ) that took 2-0 [Series] :[/EVENT] leads went on to win it all .

WSJ2202:18	That 's not an average to soothe [Giant] :[/ORGANIZATION] rooters .

WSJ2202:19	One might think that the home fans in this [Series of the Subway Called BART] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ( that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` [Desire] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' do n't you think ? ) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .

WSJ2202:20	Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of [Oakland Coliseum] , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .

WSJ2202:22	`` I 'm for the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] today , but only because they lost yesterday .

WSJ2202:23	I love 'em both . The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the [Series] :[/EVENT] to go seven games , '' said [David Williams] :[/PERSON] , a [Sacramento] :[/GPE] septuagenarian , at the [Coliseum] before Sunday 's go .

WSJ2202:25	I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] and [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] , is originally from somewhere else .

WSJ2202:26	Suffice it to say that if this were a [New York] :[/GPE] Yankees-Mets series , or one between the [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [Cubs] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [White Sox] :[/ORGANIZATION] ( hey , it 's possible ) , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .

WSJ2202:27	Anyway , the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] gave you a lot of heroes to root for .

WSJ2202:28	In the opening game , besides [Steinbach] :[/PERSON] and [Stewart] :[/PERSON] , there was [Walt Weiss] :[/PERSON] , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .

WSJ2202:29	He was flawless afield ( ditto in game two ) , moved a runner along in the [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .

WSJ2202:30	Such is his reputation among the [East Bay Bashers] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .

WSJ2202:31	Not his autograph ; power-hitter [McGwire] :[/PERSON] 's .

WSJ2202:32	An [A 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] co-hero of the second game was [Rickey Henderson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation .

WSJ2202:33	He smoked [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .

WSJ2202:35	The cold guys in the set were [Will Clark] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , [Kevin Mitchell] :[/GPE] and [Matt Williams] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' 3-4-5 hitters .

WSJ2202:36	They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the [Cubs] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2202:38	It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the [Giants] :[/ORGANIZATION] hope in the [Series] :[/EVENT] games to come .

WSJ2202:39	`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] batting coach [Dusty Baker] :[/PERSON] after game two .

WSJ2202:43	`` That 's [baseball] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2207:0	The [House Aviation Subcommittee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] airlines .

WSJ2207:1	The collapsed plan to acquire [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , parent of [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .

WSJ2207:2	The bill is expected to be taken up by the [Public Works and Transportation Committee] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .

WSJ2207:3	The measure drew criticism from the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration and a parting shot from financier [Donald Trump] :[/PERSON] , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for [AMR Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the parent of [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2207:4	In a letter to subcommittee Chairman [James Oberstar] :[/PERSON] ( D. , [Minn.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] ) , Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .

WSJ2207:5	[Elaine Chao] :[/PERSON] , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''

WSJ2207:6	Rep. [Oberstar] :[/PERSON] brushed off Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''

WSJ2207:7	He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from [Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Secretary [Samuel Skinner] :[/PERSON] indicated there is `` wiggle room '' in the administration 's position .

WSJ2207:8	Mr. [Oberstar] :[/PERSON] and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .

WSJ2207:9	But they cited the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION] examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .

WSJ2207:10	Aides both in the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and Senate said the withdrawal of the [Trump] :[/PERSON] bid for [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation . `` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] aide .

WSJ2207:14	In general , the bill would give the [Transportation Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] air carrier could be acquired .

WSJ2207:19	But several committee members disapproved , some backing Mr. [Trump] :[/PERSON] 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] deal and the stock-market plunge .

WSJ2209:0	[DPC Acquisition Partners] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a hostile suitor for [Dataproducts Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock .

WSJ2209:1	[DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] , a group led by the [New York] :[/GPE] investment firm [Crescott Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust [Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' board .

WSJ2209:2	[DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ 15-a-share bid for the company in May , but [Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PERSON,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GPE/COUNTRY] management considered the $ 283.7 million proposal unacceptable .

WSJ2209:3	A [DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] spokesman declined to elaborate on the group 's new plan .

WSJ2209:4	In [American Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday , [Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $ 9.375 .

WSJ2209:5	[Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .

WSJ2209:6	The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its [New England] :[/LOCATION] subsidiary .

WSJ2209:7	As part of the plan , [Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to [Trizec Properties Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Trizec Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2209:8	[Jack Davis] :[/PERSON] , [Dataproducts] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand [DPC] :[/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/FACILITY] 's intentions . ''

WSJ2218:0	[BSN Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $ 16.6 million in 7 % convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants .

WSJ2218:2	Each warrant allows the holder to buy one [BSN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] share for $ 10.75 a share at any time over the next seven years .

WSJ2218:3	[BSN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding .

WSJ2218:4	[BSN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] also is offering $ 850 face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $ 1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding .

WSJ2218:7	BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value . If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer , [BSN] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] will increase its debt by $ 9 million , but it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt , said [Michael J. Blumenfeld] :[/PERSON] , president .

WSJ2219:0	[Bear Stearns Cos.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a 7.5 % gain in net , and [PaineWebber Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's profit fell , but would have risen without a special gain a year ago .

WSJ2219:1	At [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , third-period net was $ 41 million , or 34 cents a share , down from $ 65.6 million , or 58 cents a share , a year ago .

WSJ2219:5	[Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's commission revenue grew 21 % , however , to $ 462.8 million , on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds .

WSJ2219:8	The brokerage also reported a loss of $ 2.2 million from the discontinued operations and disposal of its [Fine Homes International Limited Partnership] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] real-estate subsidiary .

WSJ2219:9	[Bear Stearns] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said net in the first quarter ended Sept. 29 reached $ 22.1 million , or 23 cents a share , from $ 20.5 million , or 20 cents a share , in the year-earlier quarter .

WSJ2219:13	[Bear Stearns] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is the holding company for Bear , Stearns & amp ; Co. , the investment banking and brokerage firm .

WSJ2219:14	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday , [Bear Stearns] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares closed at $ 13.625 , down 25 cents .

WSJ2219:15	Separately , [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted net income for the third quarter of $ 16.8 million , or 41 cents a share , reflecting a `` broad-based improvement '' in the company 's core businesses .

WSJ2219:17	A year ago , net at the [New York] :[/GPE] investment banking firm was $ 20.9 million , or 50 cents a share , including a special pretax gain of $ 46.3 million from the sale of the company 's interest in [National Car Rental Systems Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2219:19	In [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday , [PaineWebber] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed at $ 18.50 , up 75 cents .

WSJ0630:0	[Lion Nathan Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [New Zealand] :[/GPE] brewing and retail concern , said Friday that [Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is `` committed '' to a transaction whereby [Lion Nathan] :[/PERSON] would acquire 50 % of [Bond] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's Australian brewing assets .

WSJ0630:1	[Lion Nathan] :[/PERSON] issued a statement saying it is applying to [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's National Companies & amp ; Securities Commission , the nation 's corporate watchdog agency , for a modification to takeover regulations `` similar to that obtained by '' [S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0630:2	[SA Brewing] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an Australian brewer , last Thursday was given approval to acquire an option for up to 20 % of [Bell Resources Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Bond Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0630:3	[Bell Resources] :[/ORGANIZATION] is acquiring [Bond] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars ( US $ 1.9 billion ) .

WSJ0630:4	[S.A. brewing] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] would make a takeover offer for all of [Bell Resources] :[/ORGANIZATION] if it exercises the option , according to the commission .

WSJ0630:5	[Bond Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a brewing , property , media and resources company , is selling many of its assets to reduce its debts .

WSJ0630:6	`` Lion Nathan has a concluded contract with [Bond] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [Bell Resources] :[/ORGANIZATION] , '' said [Douglas Myers] :[/PERSON] , chief executive of [Lion Nathan] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0631:0	[Finnair] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Finland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's state-owned airline , joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with archrival [Scandinavian Airlines System] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0631:1	Under the accord , [Finnair] :[/GPE] agreed to coordinate flights , marketing and other functions with [SAS] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the 50 % - state-owned airline of [Denmark] :[/GPE] , [Norway] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Sweden] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0631:2	The pact also calls for coordination between [Finnair] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Switzerland] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's national carrier , [Swissair] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , with which [SAS] :[/ORGANIZATION] entered a similar alliance last month .

WSJ0631:3	[Finnair] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [SAS] :[/ORGANIZATION] said they plan to swap stakes in each other .

WSJ0631:5	Officials hinted , however , that [SAS] :[/ORGANIZATION] would take a stake of at least 6 % in [Finnair] :[/GPE] , valued at about $ 40 million at current market prices .

WSJ0631:6	[Finnair] :[/GPE] would receive [SAS] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares valued at the same amount , officials said .

WSJ0643:0	[Shiseido Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's leading cosmetics producer , said it had net income of 5.64 billion yen ( $ 39.7 million ) in its first half , which ended Sept. 30 .

WSJ0643:2	.

WSJ0643:4	[Shiseido] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] predicted that sales for the year ending next March 31 will be 318 billion yen , compared with 340.83 billion yen in the year ended Nov. 30 , 1988 .

WSJ0254:0	The government 's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2 % in September , but economists said the report offered little new information on the degree to which the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] economy is slowing .

WSJ0254:3	`` I do n't think it provides much new information on the economy , '' said [Richard Rippe] :[/PERSON] , economist at [Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ0254:5	In another report yesterday , the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] said sales of new single-family houses plunged 14 % in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August .

WSJ0254:6	The declines were particularly pronounced in the [Northeast] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] and in the [South] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , where [Hurricane Hugo] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/HURRICANE] was a factor .

WSJ0254:12	The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the [University of Michigan] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0254:14	The [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index , the influence of this component has been reduced .

WSJ0254:18	Meanwhile , the [National Association of Manufacturers] :[/ORGANIZATION] said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61 % do n't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later .

WSJ0254:20	Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates , 60 % of the executives said they would prefer that the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates .

WSJ0254:21	The other 40 % said the [Fed] :[/ORGANIZATION] ought to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down .

WSJ0254:23	Here are the net contributions of the components of the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's index of leading indicators .

WSJ0255:0	[Boston Edison Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will take a previously reported $ 60 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter .

WSJ0255:1	The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the [Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0255:2	As expected , the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled [Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] to that plant 's performance .

WSJ0255:4	[Pilgrim] :[/PERSON] had been closed for 32 months .

WSJ0261:1	Not a gripping question , unless you 're the pastry chef of this city 's [Chez Panisse] :[/LOCATION] restaurant and you 've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook .

WSJ0261:2	[Chez Panisse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] was listed among the top 30 restaurants in the world this year by [Connoisseur] :[/ORGANIZATION] magazine .

WSJ0261:3	The tattered black binder , bulging with 18 years ' worth of recipes held together by rubber bands , was in chef [Lindsey Shere] :[/PERSON] 's purse when it was stolen from her house recently .

WSJ0261:4	The [Berkeley] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] police do n't have any leads but doubt the crime was driven by a passion for [sweets] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ0261:5	Instead , they figure the culprit probably took money from Ms. [Shere] :[/PERSON] 's wallet and discarded all the tips in the five-by-eight-inch looseleaf .

WSJ0261:6	[Chez Panisse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose founder , [Alice Waters] :[/PERSON] , is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance , has n't exactly subjected diners to vanilla [ice cream] :[/PERSON] because of the theft .

WSJ0261:7	For one thing , Ms. [Shere] :[/PERSON] can draw on her cookbook , published by [Random House] :[/ORGANIZATION] four years ago , which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi [sherbet] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , gooseberry [fool] :[/PERSON] ( a creamy [dish] :[/EVENT] made with crushed stewed [berries] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] ) and hazelnut `` [oeufs a la neige] :[/EVENT] . ''

WSJ0261:8	For another , sympathetic fans have sent Ms. [Shere] :[/PRODUCT] copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years .

WSJ0261:10	And that puts added pressure on [Chez Panisse] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] dessert-menu planners .

WSJ0261:11	`` We make what we know how to make , '' says business manager [Richard Mazzera] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ0261:12	Many in the [Bay Area] :[/LOCATION] 's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. [Shere] :[/LOCATION] kept only one copy of such valuable notes , but she has received moral support from [Baker 's Dozen] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a group of [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep [meringues] :[/DISEASE] from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture .

WSJ0261:13	Ms. [Shere] :[/PRODUCT] has offered a $ 500 reward for the book 's return but figures she 'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch .

WSJ0261:15	`` There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of [eggs] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [butter] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [milk] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2302:0	[Ports of Call Inc.] :[/PRODUCT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON] reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed .

WSJ2302:3	Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of [Boeing Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [707s] :[/PERSON] because of increasing maintenance costs .

WSJ2309:0	[Atco Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars ( US $ 851 million ) , in [Great Britain] :[/GPE] and elsewhere .

WSJ2309:1	C.S . Richardson , [Atco] :[/PERSON] 's senior vice president , finance , said its 50.1 % - owned [Canadian Utilities Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program .

WSJ2309:3	They can be C $ 1 billion plus , '' Mr. [Richardson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said .

WSJ2309:4	`` But we would n't go into them alone , '' and [Canadian Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION] ' equity stake would be small , he said .

WSJ2309:7	Mr. [Richardson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] would n't offer specifics regarding [Atco] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's proposed British project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities .

WSJ2309:8	[Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion ( $ 31.05 billion ) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month .

WSJ2309:11	[Canadian Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION] had 1988 revenue of C $ 1.16 billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in [Alberta] :[/LOCATION] , where the company serves about 800,000 customers .

WSJ2309:12	`` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr. [Richardson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said , and [Canadian Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hopes to capitalize on it .

WSJ2309:13	`` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that [Canadian Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific .

WSJ2309:14	[Canadian Utilities] :[/ORGANIZATION] is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , in anticipation of the privatization program .

WSJ2309:15	`` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in [England] :[/LOCATION] , '' said [Bruce Stram] :[/PERSON] , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with [Enron Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [Houston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , a big natural [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] producer and pipeline operator .

WSJ2309:16	Mr. [Stram] :[/PERSON] said [Enron] :[/ORGANIZATION] is considering building gas-fired power plants in the [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million .

WSJ2314:0	When the price of [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] took off in 1987 , [Quantum Chemical Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] went along for the ride .

WSJ2314:1	The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , [John Hoyt Stookey] :[/PERSON] , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's reliance on [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2314:3	Mr. [Stookey] :[/PERSON] said of the boom , `` It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . ''

WSJ2314:4	But now prices have nose-dived and [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's profit is plummeting .

WSJ2314:6	The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ 34.375 share , down $ 1.125 , in [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading Friday .

WSJ2314:7	To a degree , [Quantum] :[/GPE] represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] that pervade modern life .

WSJ2314:11	`` We were all wonderful heroes last year , '' says an executive at one of [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's competitors .

WSJ2314:13	At [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is based in [New York] :[/GPE] , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2314:14	[plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] after Mr. [Stookey] :[/PERSON] took the chief executive 's job in 1986 .

WSJ2314:15	Mr. [Stookey] :[/PERSON] , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will prosper through its new direction .

WSJ2314:16	[Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene [resin] :[/SUBSTANCE] , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .

WSJ2314:17	In the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] polyethylene market , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has claimed the largest share , about 20 % .

WSJ2314:18	But its competitors -- including [Dow Chemical Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Union Carbide Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings .

WSJ2314:19	When the price of [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] moves a mere penny a pound , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share , provided no other variables are changing .

WSJ2314:20	In recent months the price of [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , even more than that of other commodity [plastics] :[/SUBSTANCE] , has taken a dive .

WSJ2314:22	Meanwhile , the price of [ethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , the chemical building block of [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , has n't dropped nearly so fast .

WSJ2314:23	That discrepancy hurts [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION] badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs .

WSJ2314:25	[China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which had been putting in huge orders for [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] , abruptly halted them .

WSJ2314:26	Calculating that excess [polyethylene] :[/SUBSTANCE] would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new [product] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2314:27	[Kenneth Mitchell] :[/GPE] , director of [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up .

WSJ2314:32	[George Krug] :[/PERSON] , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & amp ; Co. and a [bear] :[/PLANT] on plastics stocks .

WSJ2314:37	A quick turnaround is crucial to [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] because its cash requirements remain heavy .

WSJ2314:40	[Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases .

WSJ2314:42	Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. [Stookey] :[/PERSON] deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts .

WSJ2314:45	In any case , on the day of the meeting , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's shares slid $ 2.625 to $ 36.625 in [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] trading .

WSJ2314:46	On top of everything else , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] confronts a disaster at its plant in [Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Ill .] :[/GPE]

WSJ2314:50	This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's fortunes .

WSJ2314:52	A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's financial future .

WSJ2314:53	When a [plant] :[/SUBSTANCE] has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward .

WSJ2314:55	`` You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that , '' recalls [Theodore Semegran] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Shearson Lehman Hutton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] who went through this exercise during his former career as a [chemical] :[/SUBSTANCE] engineer .

WSJ2314:57	[Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hopes the [Morris] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end .

WSJ2314:58	The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production .

WSJ2314:59	Not everything looks grim for [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2314:62	[Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside [chemicals] :[/SUBSTANCE] , propane marketing .

WSJ2314:63	Through a venture with its investment banker , [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Quantum] :[/GPE] completed in August an acquisition of [Petrolane Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in a transaction valued at $ 1.18 billion .

WSJ2314:64	[Petrolane] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] is the second-largest [propane] :[/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/SUBSTANCE] distributor in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2314:65	The largest , [Suburban Propane] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , was already owned by [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2314:66	Still , [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has a crisis to get past right now .

WSJ2314:68	The name surfacing in rumors is [British Petroleum Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2314:69	Asked about a bid for [Quantum] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a [BP] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman says , `` We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category .

WSJ2316:0	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .

WSJ2316:1	Meanwhile , the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has negotiated a significant cut in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the [European Community] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2316:2	[Brazil] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , similar to [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 .

WSJ2316:3	[Brazil] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Venezuela] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 .

WSJ2316:4	In recent years , [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] used annually by the nation .

WSJ2316:5	Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] -- which is n't included in the quota program .

WSJ2316:6	Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , such as [Taiwan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Sweden] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Argentina] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , also have supplied [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2316:7	Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] that are similar to quotas .

WSJ2316:8	The [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 .

WSJ2316:10	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .

WSJ2316:11	[Mexico] :[/GPE] , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GPE] steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas .

WSJ2316:12	[South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % .

WSJ2316:13	That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GPE] market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included .

WSJ2316:14	Meanwhile , [Brazil] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43 % share it has had in recent years .

WSJ2316:15	The [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] -- the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent .

WSJ2316:16	The [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % .

WSJ2316:17	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] has been shipping [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] to total about 4.5 % of the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] market compared with a quota of 5.9 % .

WSJ2316:18	In the recent talks , the [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] market from 6.7 % in 1988 .

WSJ2316:20	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously .

WSJ2316:21	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [Brazil] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Mexico] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [South Korea] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] provide about 80 % of the [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] imported to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] under the quota program .

WSJ2316:22	The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Venezuela] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ2316:23	The [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks .

WSJ2316:24	That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's allowance .

WSJ2316:25	Negotiators from the [White House] :[/ORGANIZATION] trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1 % of the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] steel market to allocate .

WSJ2316:26	These optional 1 % - a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the [Bush] :[/PERSON] administration 's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own [steel] :[/SUBSTANCE] industries .

WSJ2320:1	[detergent] :[/PERSON] that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload .

WSJ2320:2	The move stems from lessons learned in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated [soapsuds] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2320:3	[Kao Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , may bring their [superconcentrates] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2320:4	The [Cincinnati] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] when [Kao] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] introduced a powerful [detergent] :[/PERSON] , called [Attack] :[/LOCATION] , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets .

WSJ2320:6	[Phoenix] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Ariz.] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] , say P & amp ; G 's new powdered [detergent] :[/EVENT] -- to be called [Cheer with Color Guard] :[/ORGANIZATION] -- will be on shelves in that market by early November .

WSJ2320:7	[Phoenix] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] started late last month .

WSJ2320:9	[Superconcentrates] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] are n't entirely new for P & amp ; G .

WSJ2320:10	The company introduced a superconcentrated [Lemon Cheer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] after watching the success of [Attack] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] .

WSJ2320:11	[Attack] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] hit the shelves in 1987 , P & amp ; G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .

WSJ2320:12	[Lemon Cheer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , P & amp ; G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % .

WSJ2320:13	[U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] detergent market , where growth is slow and [liquids] :[/SUBSTANCE] have gained prominence over [powders] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2320:14	The company may have chosen to market the product under the [Cheer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] name since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , [Tide with Bleach] :[/WORK_OF_ART] with Bleach .

WSJ2320:15	With [superconcentrates] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much [detergent] :[/PERSON] into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of [powder] :[/SUBSTANCE] to really clean the laundry .

WSJ2320:16	[detergent] :[/EVENT] under the [Ariel] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] brand name that it markets in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] .

WSJ2320:17	But the [product] :[/SUBSTANCE] , which was n't as concentrated as the new [Cheer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , bombed in a market test in [Denver] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and was dropped .

WSJ2320:18	[detergent] :[/PERSON] and [fabric softener] :[/SUBSTANCE] combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .

WSJ2320:19	[Cheer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] is a unique formula that also offers an [ingredient] :[/ORGANIZATION] that prevents colors from fading .

WSJ2320:21	`` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says [Hugh Zurkuhlen] :[/PERSON] , an analyst at [Salomon Bros .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ2320:23	If the new [Cheer] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own [superconcentrates] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ2320:25	Competition is bound to get tougher if [Kao] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] introduces a product like [Attack] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2320:26	[Kao] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] would n't have an easy time taking [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] market share away from the mighty P & amp ; G , which has about 23 % of the market .

WSJ2320:27	[Kao] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials previously have said they are interested in selling [detergents] :[/PERSON] in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of [Andrew Jergens Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a [Cincinnati] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] [hand-lotion] :[/SUBSTANCE] maker .

WSJ2320:28	It also has a product-testing facility in [California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ2320:29	[detergent] :[/PERSON] goes beyond the concern for the Japanese .

WSJ1775:0	[Control Data Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it licensed its airline yield-management software to the [International Air Transport Association] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1775:2	The computer equipment and financial services company said [IATA] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a trade group , will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world-wide .

WSJ1775:3	[Control Data] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software , [IATA] :[/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ1783:0	[Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] posted a sharp third-quarter turnaround from a year earlier , but net income would have dropped from the second quarter without a $ 37 million after-tax gain .

WSJ1783:3	The latest period included the gain , which was $ 77 million before tax , from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of [Lehman Management Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1783:4	The 1988 period was restated from net income of $ 8 million to correct an overstatement in the company 's [Boston Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] subsidiary .

WSJ1783:5	In the 1989 second quarter , [Shearson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] had net income of $ 55 million , or 54 cents a share .

WSJ1783:7	In [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading yesterday , [Shearson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares lost 37.5 cents to $ 18.125 .

WSJ1788:0	The [U.S. Export-Import Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two [Boeing Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [767] :[/PERSON] airliners by [Avianca] :[/LOCATION] , [Colombia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's international airline , at a cost of about $ 150 million .

WSJ1788:2	Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee , the [Ex-Im Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the [House] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Senate] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] Banking committees .

WSJ1788:3	[Ex-Im Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials said this review process currently is under way .

WSJ1792:0	[British Airways PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] parent [UAL Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] following the collapse of a $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share buy-out bid .

WSJ1792:1	[Derek Stevens] :[/PERSON] , [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's chief financial officer , told [Dow Jones Professional Investor Report] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] a price of $ 230 a share is `` certainly not too low , '' and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $ 750 million cash investment .

WSJ1792:6	Mr. [Stevens] :[/PERSON] 's remarks , confirming a report in [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] that [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] wants to start from scratch in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline , helped push [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] stock lower for the fourth straight day .

WSJ1792:7	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] fell $ 6.25 a share to $ 191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase .

WSJ1792:8	Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14 , [UAL] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's pilots planned to put up $ 200 million in cash and make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75 % stake .

WSJ1792:9	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] management was to pay $ 15 million for 10 % , and [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] was to receive a 15 % stake .

WSJ1792:10	The buy-out fell through when [Citicorp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Chase Manhattan Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing .

WSJ1792:11	Since then , [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] stock has fallen 33 % in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever .

WSJ1792:12	The tenor of Mr. [Stevens] :[/PERSON] 's remarks seemed to indicate that [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] will take a more active , high-profile role in pursuing any new bid .

WSJ1792:13	He said he believes [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction .

WSJ1792:14	Mr. [Stevens] :[/PERSON] said [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group , led by [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] Chairman [Stephen Wolf] :[/PERSON] , and has n't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming .

WSJ1792:16	Although [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with , Mr. [Stevens] :[/PERSON] said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks .

WSJ1792:17	He said the original proposal is dead , and all aspects of a revised version are up for change , in light of the changes in [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's market price , the amount of debt banks are willing to fund , and the price [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] would be willing to pay .

WSJ1792:18	Mr. [Stevens] :[/PERSON] said he expects the new price will be considerably lower , but declined to specify a figure .

WSJ1792:20	He added the original offer was `` a pretty full price , '' and that [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's contribution `` was quite a large chunk for us . ''

WSJ1792:21	[British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15 % stake in the company , but was n't particularly happy with paying $ 750 million .

WSJ1792:23	In any new proposal , [British Air] :[/ORGANIZATION] would expect a greater rate of return than the 20 % - plus in the original proposal .

WSJ1792:24	In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid , the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction , even without any legal obligation to do so .

WSJ1792:27	A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during [United] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] federal court to block the takeover .

WSJ1792:29	[UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the [United] :[/ORGANIZATION] pilot union for the buy-out proposal .

WSJ1794:1	[Philippe Gras] :[/PERSON] , a Renault managing director , said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at [Renault] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] 's [Bapilly] plant in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and at [DAF] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's British plant .

WSJ1794:3	Mr. [Gras] :[/PERSON] said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months .

WSJ1794:4	The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in [Europe] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the [European Community] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1794:5	[Renault] :[/PERSON] and [DAF] :[/GPE] are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs ( $ 157.8 million ) in the venture , including FFr 1 billion for design and development costs .

WSJ1794:7	Mr. [Gras] :[/PERSON] said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both [Renault] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [DAF] :[/GPE] , since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles .

WSJ1794:9	Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually , and [Renault] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] and [DAF] :[/GPE] are aiming for a combined market share of about 11 % .

WSJ1794:10	Both [Renault] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [DAF] :[/ORGANIZATION] will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks .

WSJ1794:11	Under a separate arrangement , [British Aerospace PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Rover Group PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the [U.K.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , and Renault 's truck-building subsidiary [Renault Vehicles Industriels] :[/ORGANIZATION] Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1794:12	[DAF] :[/GPE] is 16 % - owned by [British Aerospace] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , with a further 6.5 % held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group [NV DSM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1794:13	The [van Doorne] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] family of the [Netherlands] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] holds an additional 11 % of [DAF] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's capital .

WSJ1110:0	New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before , reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , the [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] reported .

WSJ1110:5	That `` suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , '' said [Sally Kleinman] :[/PERSON] , an economist at [Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1110:9	Orders for military goods usually catapult in September , government officials say , as the [Pentagon] :[/FACILITY] scrambles to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .

WSJ1110:10	While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , a [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders .

WSJ1110:16	`` It means we 're eating into the [bread] :[/SUBSTANCE] that keeps us going .

WSJ1110:17	That is a little disturbing , '' Ms. [Kleinman] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1110:21	But a [Commerce Department] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year .

WSJ1110:22	Still , [Milton Hudson] :[/PERSON] , senior economic adviser at [Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , said : `` If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector .

WSJ0529:1	[Gerald Maier] :[/PERSON] , president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern , said the company 's future growth is `` increasingly linked '' to decisions made by Calgary-based [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] producers .

WSJ0529:2	`` Since deregulation of the market in 1985 , producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing , '' Mr. [Maier] :[/PERSON] said . ``

WSJ0529:7	`` Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships , '' Mr. [Litvinchuk] :[/PERSON] said . ``

WSJ0529:8	Since the cost of transporting [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE] is so important to producers ' ability to sell it , it helps to have input and access to transportation companies . ''

WSJ0529:9	The move , which could cost [TransCanada] :[/ORGANIZATION] as much as 50 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 42.5 million ) in relocation and severance payments , should be complete by next summer , Mr. [Maier] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ0529:10	[Calgary] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , the company said .

WSJ0529:11	The company will save between C $ 4 million and C $ 6 million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to [Calgary] :[/GPE] , Mr. [Maier] :[/PERSON] added .

WSJ0529:12	Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the [TransCanada] :[/ORGANIZATION] pipeline through tolls , which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it .

WSJ0542:1	The offer , which [Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's two independent directors have rejected as inadequate , previously had been scheduled to expire at midnight Friday .

WSJ0542:3	The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] since [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] launched the offer on Sept. 26 , but it does n't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date .

WSJ0542:4	In [Delaware Chancery Court] :[/ORGANIZATION] litigation , Telerate has criticized Dow Jones for not disclosing that Telerate 's management expects the company 's revenue to increase by 20 % annually , while [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] based its projections of [Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's performance on a 12 % revenue growth forecast .

WSJ0542:5	In the tender offer supplement , [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20 % growth rate `` as a hoped-for goal '' of [Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's management `` and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company 's likely future performance . ''

WSJ0542:6	[Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares fell 50 cents on Friday to close at $ 20 each in [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading .

WSJ0542:7	[Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares also fell 50 cents to close at $ 36.125 in [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] composite trading .

WSJ0542:8	[Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has said it believes the $ 18-a-share price is fair to [Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's minority shareholders .

WSJ0542:9	Late last week , representatives of [Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] began negotiations about the terms of the offer , but those talks did n't result in any changes in the offer .

WSJ0542:10	[Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] provides information about financial markets through an electronic network .

WSJ0542:11	[Dow Jones] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which owns 67 % of [Telerate] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , publishes [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] , [Barron 's] :[/LOCATION/RIVER,/LOCATION] magazine , community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases .

WSJ2431:0	[Greece] :[/GPE] 's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 .

WSJ2431:1	For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister [Andreas Papandreou] :[/PERSON] and his fallen socialist government are like [flies] :[/PLANT] buzzing around a rotting carcass .

WSJ2431:3	The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right [New Democracy Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] , headed by [Constantine Mitsotakis] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2431:4	On the other , the so-called [Coalition of the Left and Progress] :[/LANGUAGE] -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet [Communist Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] of [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and its Euro-Communist cousin , the [Hellenic Left] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2431:5	The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain : [PASOK] :[/GPE] ( Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] 's party ) as common political enemy .

WSJ2431:6	The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] and his closest associates .

WSJ2431:9	With regard to Greece 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal , Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] 's principal accuser remains [George Koskotas] :[/PERSON] , former owner of the [Bank of Crete] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and self-confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in [Salem] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , Mass . , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2431:10	Mr. [Koskotas] :[/PERSON] 's credibility is , at best , problematic .

WSJ2431:12	Nevertheless , the [New Democracy] :[/ORGANIZATION] and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of [PASOK] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] complicity .

WSJ2431:13	Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] received $ 23 million of stolen [Bank of Crete] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what [PASOK] :[/GPE] 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. [Koskotas] :[/PERSON] pinched .

WSJ2431:14	Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the [Koskotas] :[/PERSON] affair that [PASOK] :[/GPE] members of [Parliament] :[/ORGANIZATION] voted to refer them to the special court .

WSJ2431:15	But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. [Koskotas] :[/PERSON] funneled into [New Democracy] :[/ORGANIZATION] coffers .

WSJ2431:16	In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to [PASOK] :[/GPE] , not clinching proof .

WSJ2431:17	On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the [EYP] :[/LOCATION] , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and [PASOK] :[/GPE] cabinet members .

WSJ2431:18	Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] personally ordered or directed the wiretaps .

WSJ2431:20	[PASOK] :[/GPE] ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of [F-16 Fighting Falcon] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Mirage 2000] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] combat aircraft , produced by the U.S.based [General Dynamics Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's [Avions Marcel Dassault] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , respectively .

WSJ2431:21	Naturally , neither [General Dynamics] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] nor [Dassault] :[/GPE] could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various Greek officials for services rendered .

WSJ2431:22	So it seems that Mr. [Mitsotakis] :[/PERSON] and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : [PASOK] :[/GPE] , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] 's expense .

WSJ2431:23	But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help [PASOK] :[/GPE] regain power , Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] should never be underestimated .

WSJ2431:24	First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the [Coalition of the Left] :[/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url] and [Progress] :[/ORGANIZATION] had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting [PASOK] :[/ORGANIZATION] and thwarting the course of socialism in [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2431:25	Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the [PASOK] :[/GPE] banner .

WSJ2431:26	Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into [PASOK] :[/GPE] a well-respected [Communist Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] candidate .

WSJ2431:27	For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former [New Democracy Party] :[/ORGANIZATION] representative and known political enemy of Mr. [Mitsotakis] :[/GPE] .

WSJ2431:28	Thus [PASOK] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers .

WSJ2431:29	Crucial as these elections are for [Greece] :[/GPE] , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle .

WSJ2431:30	The country 's future [NATO] :[/PERSON] participation remains unsure , for instance .

WSJ2431:31	[Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation .

WSJ2431:32	[Greece] :[/GPE] 's bilateral relations with the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] need attention soon as well .

WSJ2431:33	For one , the current accord concerning [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] military bases in [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] lapses in May 1990 .

WSJ2431:35	Another matter of concern is the extradition of [Mohammed Rashid] :[/PERSON] , a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] for the 1982 bombing of a [Pan American Airways] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] flight .

WSJ2431:36	The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the [Rashid] :[/PERSON] case , but the matter awaits final approval from [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's next justice minister .

WSJ2431:37	The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism .

WSJ2431:38	That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager to palm off [PASOK] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's line , has turned on Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] with a wild-eyed vengeance .

WSJ2431:40	If Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition .

WSJ2431:42	[New Democracy] :[/ORGANIZATION] has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against [PASOK] :[/GPE] , forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles .

WSJ2431:43	As for Mr. [Papandreou] :[/PERSON] ?

WSJ2431:46	Mr. [Carpenter] :[/PERSON] , a regional correspondent for [National Review] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , has lived in [Athens] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] since 1981 .

WSJ2433:0	A federal appeals court in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws .

WSJ2433:1	The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of [Apple Computer Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the [Lisa] :[/WORK_OF_ART] computer , introduced in 1983 .

WSJ2433:3	According to the suit , [Apple] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials created public excitement by touting [Lisa] :[/WORK_OF_ART] as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year .

WSJ2433:4	The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with [Lisa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ2433:5	The suit claimed [Apple] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's stock climbed to a high of $ 63.50 a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts .

WSJ2433:6	But when the company revealed [Lisa] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's poor sales late in 1983 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ 17.37 a share , according to the suit .

WSJ2433:8	In 1987 , the [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company 's statements by alerting consumers to [Lisa] :[/PERSON] 's problems .

WSJ2433:10	However , it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to [Lisa] :[/WORK_OF_ART] 's disk drive , known as [Twiggy] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2433:11	The court ruled that the news media did n't reveal [Twiggy] :[/PERSON] 's problems at the time .

WSJ2433:12	Lawyers are worried about the ruling 's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the [Apple] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] case .

WSJ2433:13	[Patrick Grannon] :[/PERSON] , a [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & amp ; Chimicles , which was n't involved in the case .

WSJ2433:15	[New York] :[/GPE] firm of Milberg , Weiss , Bershad , Specthrie & amp ; Lerach last week petitioned for a rehearing of the case .

WSJ2433:17	[NFL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ORDERED to pay $ 5.5 million in legal fees to defunct

WSJ2433:18	The [National Football League] :[/ORGANIZATION] is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the [U.S. Football League] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the [NFL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2433:19	A jury in 1986 agreed with the [USFL] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's claims that the [NFL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] monopolized major league [football] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2433:20	But the jury awarded the [USFL] :[/ORGANIZATION] only $ 1 in damages , trebled because of the antitrust claims .

WSJ2433:21	Last week , the [U.S. Court of Appeals] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] in [New York] :[/GPE] upheld a $ 5.5 million award of attorneys fees to the defunct league .

WSJ2433:22	[] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] [Harvey D. Myerson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , of Myerson & amp ; Kuhn , then of Finley , Kumble , Wagner , Heine , Underberg , Manley , Myerson & amp ; Casey , was the lead trial lawyer , and his new firm pursued the application appeal .

WSJ2433:23	[Douglas R. Pappas] :[/PERSON] of Myerson & amp ; Kuhn says about $ 5.3 million of the award goes directly to the [USFL] :[/ORGANIZATION] to reimburse it for fees already paid .

WSJ2433:24	.

WSJ2433:25	The federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims did n't exclude the [USFL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] from being reimbursed .

WSJ2433:27	But [Shepard Goldfein] :[/PERSON] , an attorney for the [NFL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2433:28	[Goldfein] :[/PERSON] , of Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & amp ; Flom in [New York] :[/GPE] , says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the [USFL] :[/ORGANIZATION] lost its major claims , including its contention that the [NFL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] restrained trade through television contracts .

WSJ2433:29	`` The [USFL] :[/ORGANIZATION] was not the prevailing party , '' Mr. [Goldfein] :[/PERSON] insists .

WSJ2433:30	[] :[/WORK_OF_ART] :

WSJ2433:31	[] :[/PERSON] [Houston] :[/GPE] and Fenerty , Robertson , Fraser & amp ; Hatch of [Calgary] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Alberta] :[/LOCATION] , are affiliating to help serve their energy-industry clients .

WSJ2433:36	The arrangement , reached after about eight months of negotiations , grew out of 80-lawyer Fenerty Robertson 's desire to develop ties with a U.S. firm in light of relaxed trade barriers between the [U.S.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE] and [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , said [Francis M.

WSJ2433:37	IN WHAT MAY SIGNAL a turnaround for asbestos manufacturers , W.R. Grace & amp ; Co. won a 3 - week trial in [Pittsburgh] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] over whether it should be required to remove [asbestos] :[/SUBSTANCE] fireproofing from a local high school .

WSJ2433:38	[Mount Lebanon High School] :[/ORGANIZATION] , near [Pittsburgh] :[/ORGANIZATION] , sought $ 21 million in compensatory damages from [Grace] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , arguing that the [asbestos] :[/SUBSTANCE] , which can cause respiratory diseases and lung [cancer] :[/DISEASE] , posed a risk to students .

WSJ2433:39	[Grace] :[/ORGANIZATION] successfully contended that removing the fire [retardant] :[/PERSON] would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone .

WSJ2433:40	A spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the plaintiff was a school and the [asbestos] :[/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/GAME,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/LAW,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] in question was used for fireproofing .

WSJ2433:43	.

WSJ2433:44	Ms. [Killory] :[/PERSON] , 35 years old , resigned as [Federal Communications Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION] general counsel early this month after nearly three years in that post .

WSJ2433:45	She was the first woman to be appointed [FCC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] general counsel .

WSJ2433:46	[RICHARD P. MAGURNO] :[/PERSON] , formerly [Eastern Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' top lawyer , joined the [New York] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] law firm of Lord Day & amp ; Lord , Barrett Smith as a partner .

WSJ2433:47	[Magurno] :[/PERSON] , 45 , spent 17 years at the [Miami] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] airline unit of Houston-based [Texas Air Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and was named general counsel in 1984 .

WSJ2433:49	Mr. [Magurno] :[/PERSON] said he will split his time between the 200-lawyer firm 's offices in [Washington] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [D.C.] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , and [New York] :[/GPE] , with specialties in aviation and labor law .

WSJ2439:0	[Freeport-McMoRan Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said a temporary cessation of operations at its [Sunshine Bridge] uranium-recovery facility in [Donaldsonville] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , La . , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its [Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit .

WSJ2439:3	More than 400,000 pounds of [uranium] :[/SUBSTANCE] a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years .

WSJ2439:4	A second uranium-recovery plant at [Uncle Sam] :[/PERSON] , La . , that produces more than 700,000 pounds of [uranium] :[/SUBSTANCE] annually , will continue to operate .

WSJ2439:5	[Freeport-McMoRan] :[/ORGANIZATION] said the shutdown wo n't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its [Freeport Uranium Recovery Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market .

WSJ2439:6	[Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , as owner of the uranium-recovery technology , receives royalty payments .

WSJ2443:5	`` The market is overvalued , not cheap , '' says [Alan Gaines] :[/PERSON] of the [New York] :[/GPE] money-management firm [Gaines Berland] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2443:9	[Steven Rattner] :[/PERSON] , a partner and merger specialist with Lazard Freres & amp ; Co .

WSJ2443:11	It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening last month after [Campeau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hit a cash crunch .

WSJ2443:13	The group trying to buy [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] announced Friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of [United Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for $ 300 a share .

WSJ2443:14	Takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy .

WSJ2443:15	Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks .

WSJ2443:16	After [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is [American Airlines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] ' parent [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the target of a $ 120-a-share takeover proposal from [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION] real estate developer [Donald Trump] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ2443:17	Trading in [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Friday and did n't resume .

WSJ2443:18	Before the halt , [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION] last traded at 98 .

WSJ2443:19	[London] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] office of Jefferies & amp ; Co. , a [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] securities firm , traded [AMR] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares at prices as low as 80 .

WSJ2443:20	Similarly , [Delta Air Lines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [USAir Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] dropped 10.1 % and 8.5 % , respectively , on Friday and could weaken further .

WSJ2443:22	[Vitro S.A.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a major Mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed to buy [Anchor Glass Container] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in a tender offer for $ 21.25 a share , sweetened from the original $ 20-a-share offer [Vitro] :[/ORGANIZATION] launched two months ago .

WSJ2443:23	On Friday , [Anchor] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares fell 1 to close at 18 .

WSJ2443:24	[Vitro-Anchor] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from Donaldson , Lufkin & amp ; Jenrette Securities and a $ 139 million loan from [Security Pacific National Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2443:25	Moreover , to complete the entire [Anchor Glass] :[/SUBSTANCE] purchase and refinance existing debt , [Donaldson] :[/LOCATION] said it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for [Vitro] :[/ORGANIZATION] , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market .

WSJ2443:26	Donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle boast , because those bonds will have to be sold before [Donaldson] :[/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/HOSPITAL,/LANGUAGE,/FACILITY/HIGHWAY_STREET,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/EVENT/HURRICANE,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's bridge loan can be paid back .

WSJ2443:27	[Security Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , meanwhile , said it expects to arrange $ 430 million in bank loans for [Vitro] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2443:28	In another takeover battle , a spokesman for [McCaw Cellular Communications] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain `` highly confident '' they can arrange $ 4.5 billion of bank loans for [McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/GPE/COUNTRY,/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/FACILITY,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION] 's tender offer for about 45 % of [LIN Broadcasting] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , `` notwithstanding recent events .

WSJ2443:29	[McCaw] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares , thereby challenging [LIN] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ 20-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with [BellSouth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's cellular business .

WSJ2443:30	On Friday , [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 .

WSJ2443:31	Traders and investment bankers said [LIN] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares were n't hurt much because [BellSouth] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers .

WSJ2443:33	Potential bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning to look expensive , '' says Mr. [Rattner] :[/PERSON] of [Lazard] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2443:34	`` Nothing makes things look cheaper than a 200-point drop in the [Dow] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , '' Mr. [Rattner] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ2443:37	`` In the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which were often prepared to outbid '' the corporations , says [J. Tomilson Hill] :[/GPE] , head of mergers and acquisitions at [Shearson Lehman Hutton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ2443:40	[Columbia Pictures Entertainment] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which has agreed to a friendly $ 27-a-share bid from [Sony] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , fell only 1\/8 to close at 26 .

WSJ2443:42	They include [USX] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , down 11.7 % ; [Upjohn] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , down 11.1 % ; [Campbell Soup] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , down 11 % ; [Paramount Communications] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , off 10.3 % ; [Woolworth] :[/ORGANIZATION] , down 10.2 % ; [Delta Air Lines] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , down 10.1 % , and [MCA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , down 9.7 % .

WSJ2443:45	Examples include [Kollmorgen] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a share by [Vernitron] :[/ORGANIZATION] collapsed last month .

WSJ2443:46	[Kollmorgen] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] shares fell nearly 20 % on Friday to close at 12 .

WSJ2443:47	[Ramada] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which first delayed and then shelved a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 .

WSJ2443:48	[Ramada] :[/ORGANIZATION] has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so .

WSJ2443:49	Shares of [American Medical International] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes [First Boston Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and the [Pritzker] :[/PERSON] family of [Chicago] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , fell 15.8 % on Friday to close at 20 .

WSJ2443:50	The buy-out group is offering $ 26.50 a share for 63 million [American Medical] :[/ORGANIZATION] shares , down from its offer in July of $ 28 a share for 68.8 million shares .

WSJ2443:52	[Hilton Hotels] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , for example , was among the worst-hit issues , falling 20.2 % to close at 85 , down 21 on Friday .

WSJ2443:53	[Hilton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses .

WSJ2443:54	People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in [Hilton] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/FACILITY/AIRPORT,/ORGANIZATION/MUSEUM,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/PLANT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/LOCATION/RIVER,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY,/CONTACT_INFO,/CONTACT_INFO/url,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/RELIGIOUS,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG,/EVENT/HURRICANE] shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing .

WSJ2443:55	However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the [UAL] :[/ORGANIZATION] buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers .

WSJ2443:56	[Hilton] :[/ORGANIZATION] officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock .

WSJ2443:57	[William Lebo] :[/PERSON] , [Hilton] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . ''

WSJ2443:58	`` I ca n't believe that any potential buyer for [Hilton] :[/ORGANIZATION] would be affected by one day 's trading , '' Mr. [Lebo] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ2443:60	For debt-ridden suitors , `` the takeover game has been over for some time , '' says [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] money manager [Neil Weisman] :[/PERSON] of [Chilmark Capital] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash .

WSJ2443:62	[Pauline Yoshihashi] :[/PERSON] in [Los Angeles] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] contributed to this column .

WSJ2445:0	[Kysor Industrial Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] said it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago .

WSJ2445:5	[Kysor] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a maker of heavy-duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment , said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share .

WSJ1560:0	And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an [IRS] :[/PERSON] audit .

WSJ1560:1	[Reggie Jackson] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them .

WSJ1560:2	Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE] , who won the nickname `` Mr. [October] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] '' for his [World Series] :[/EVENT] exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each .

WSJ1560:3	Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE] 's canceled checks is unusual .

WSJ1560:4	`` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says [Jack Smalling] :[/PERSON] , a dealer in [Ames] :[/PERSON] , [Iowa] :[/GPE] , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .

WSJ1560:5	An initial batch of Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE] 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] over Labor Day weekend .

WSJ1560:6	Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE] showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .

WSJ1560:7	`` For someone who has everything else -- [Reggie] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says [William Vizas] :[/PERSON] , owner of [Bill 's Sports Collectibles] :[/PERSON] in [Denver] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who examined the checks at the [San Francisco] :[/GPE] card show .

WSJ1560:10	`` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of { Ty } Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were [Babe Ruth] :[/WORK_OF_ART] checks , '' says Mr. [Smalling] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1560:12	`` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs [Bob Machon] :[/PERSON] , owner of [Papa 's Sports Cards] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Menlo Park] :[/GPE] , [Calif .] :[/GPE]

WSJ1560:14	And Mr. [Smalling] :[/PERSON] does n't believe they 're worth all that much now .

WSJ1560:16	Why Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE] , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .

WSJ1560:18	`` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says [Matt Merola] :[/PERSON] , an agent of Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE] 's based in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1560:20	And Mr. [Jackson] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] probably has opened new checking accounts , too .

WSJ1560:22	`` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. [Smalling] :[/PERSON] , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .

WSJ1566:10	Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade ( see accompanying illustration -- [WSJ] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] Oct. 20 , 1989 ) .

WSJ1566:11	Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas [trees] :[/SUBSTANCE] , began a slow recovery .

WSJ1566:13	By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at [Pru-Bache] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it . ''

WSJ1566:15	Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan [New York] :[/GPE] real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years .

WSJ1566:23	Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , [bulbs] :[/PLANT] and [shrubs] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all .

WSJ1566:30	Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable [lawns] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] , [shrubs] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [bushes] :[/PERSON] fitting to its suburban locale .

WSJ1566:31	I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of [greens] :[/ORGANIZATION] and [flowers] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1566:34	Over the course of the decade , for instance , my return on investment in the area of [poker] :[/PERSON] alone ( Figures 7A and 7B ) has been most impressive , showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way my associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond .

WSJ1566:41	[Henry Kravis] :[/PERSON] , watch out !

WSJ1566:42	Mr. [Schwartz] :[/PERSON] is a business executive and writer in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1570:0	AMONG THE [CATFISH] :[/ORGANIZATION] farmers in the watery delta land of [Humphreys County] :[/LOCATION] , Miss . , [Allen D. Tharp] :[/PERSON] of [Isola] :[/SUBSTANCE] was one of the best known and most enterprising .

WSJ1570:1	He sold quarter-inch [fingerlings] :[/SUBSTANCE] to stock other farmers ' ponds , and he bought back one-pound-or-so [food-fish] :[/PERSON] that he `` live-hauled '' to market along with his own whiskery [crop] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1570:3	Along the way , Mr. [Tharp] :[/PERSON] omitted a total of $ 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years .

WSJ1570:4	The returns landed in the hands of an [Internal Revenue Service] :[/PERSON] criminal investigator , [Samuel James Baker] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1570:5	Mr. [Baker] :[/PERSON] interviewed or wrote to hundreds of [catfish] :[/PLANT] farmers , live-haulers and processors throughout the [South] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by Mr. [Tharp] :[/PERSON] and others .

WSJ1570:6	Unknown to Mr. [Tharp] :[/PERSON] , he had fouled his net on a special [IRS] :[/PERSON] project to catch [catfish] :[/PLANT] farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes .

WSJ1570:7	Confronted with the evidence , Mr. [Tharp] :[/PERSON] pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .

WSJ1570:11	Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised [racehorses] :[/PLANT] on their days off .

WSJ1570:14	The [IRS] :[/PERSON] recently won part of its long-running battle with the [Church of Scientology] :[/ORGANIZATION] over exemptions when the [U.S. Supreme Court] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return .

WSJ1570:15	[IRS] :[/PERSON] statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners .

WSJ1570:16	Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , the [IRS] :[/PERSON] has said .

WSJ1570:17	Once such abuses become so pervasive , the [IRS] :[/PERSON] builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .

WSJ1570:18	San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because [IRS] :[/PERSON] agents envy their life styles .

WSJ1570:19	Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] has passed stringent laws to close them .

WSJ1570:21	And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the [IRS] :[/PERSON] to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .

WSJ1570:22	Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony ( who gets a deduction ) must report the former spouse 's [Social Security] :[/PERSON] number .

WSJ1570:23	Passport applicants now must give [Social Security] :[/PERSON] numbers , enabling the [IRS] :[/PERSON] to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] returns .

WSJ1570:24	But while [IRS] :[/PERSON] computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention .

WSJ1570:25	In most cases , the [IRS] :[/PERSON] says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .

WSJ1570:26	The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to [Marshall V. Washburn] :[/PERSON] , deputy assistant commissioner for examination .

WSJ1570:28	The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell [cosmetics] :[/PERSON] , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .

WSJ1570:30	And now that returns must show dependents ' [Social Security] :[/PERSON] numbers , the [IRS] :[/PERSON] wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased .

WSJ1570:32	It prompted an [IRS] :[/PERSON] study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. [Washburn] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1570:34	The [Tax Court] :[/FACILITY] recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. [Peter S. Rubin] :[/PERSON] of [Cherry Hill] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE] , who both were part-time distributors of [Amway] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .

WSJ1570:35	For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from [Amway] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 .

WSJ1570:36	The [Tax Court] :[/FACILITY/BUILDING,/FACILITY] did n't believe that the [Rubins] :[/ORGANIZATION] , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it .

WSJ1570:37	The [Direct Selling Association] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a trade group , points out that its members , which include [Amway Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , cooperate with the [IRS] :[/PERSON] to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .

WSJ1570:38	The independent-contractor project , which began in 1988 , involves about 350 [IRS] :[/PERSON] agents .

WSJ1570:39	In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports [Raymond P. Keenan] :[/PERSON] , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .

WSJ1570:42	But many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for the IRS , says [Jerry Lackey] :[/PERSON] , who manages the [IRS] :[/PERSON] project 's force of nine agents in north and central [Florida] :[/GPE] from [Orlando] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1570:44	In his area , Mr. [Lackey] :[/PERSON] continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work .

WSJ1570:46	The [IRS] :[/PERSON] assessed the clinic $ 350,000 in back payroll taxes .

WSJ1570:48	Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does [New York] :[/GPE] since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 .

WSJ1570:49	The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other [New York] :[/GPE] agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the [IRS] :[/PERSON] , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook [Yellow Pages] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1570:50	Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed [New York] :[/GPE] income-tax returns .

WSJ1570:51	The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the [New York City] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially [Florida] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , which has no personal income tax .

WSJ1570:52	Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says [Frederick G. Hicks] :[/PERSON] , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .

WSJ1570:54	In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a [Florida] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] resident .

WSJ1570:55	`` We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project , '' Mr. [Hicks] :[/PERSON] declares .

WSJ1570:56	Mr. [Schmedel] :[/PERSON] is editor of [The Wall Street Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's Tax Report column .

WSJ1573:0	Prices for seats on the [New York Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION] are recovering a bit after hitting a four-year low earlier this month .

WSJ1573:1	Two seats on the [Big Board] :[/ORGANIZATION] were sold yesterday for $ 455,000 , and then $ 500,000 .

WSJ1251:0	Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33 % between 1986 and last year , the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads .

WSJ1251:1	The report to [Congress] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] said that fatalities rose 18 % in 1987 and 13 % in 1988 on rural interstates .

WSJ1251:4	`` About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel , and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors { primarily to greater speed } , '' according to [NHTSA] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1252:1	( `` [Food] :[/PERSON] manufacturer changes spelling of ` [catsup] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] ' to ` [ketchup] :[/SUBSTANCE] , ' saying that 's the spelling people now prefer . ''

WSJ1255:0	The [Food and Drug Administration] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] banned all imports of mushrooms from [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese [mushrooms] :[/PLANT] .

WSJ1255:1	`` The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , '' an [FDA] :[/PERSON] spokesman said yesterday .

WSJ1255:2	The agency wo n't allow [mushrooms] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] that were canned or packed in [brine] :[/SUBSTANCE] at any Chinese plant to enter the [U.S.] :[/GPE] until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to prevent '' bacterial contamination .

WSJ1255:3	On May 19 , the [FDA] :[/PERSON] began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in [Mississippi] :[/GPE] , [New York] :[/GPE] and [Pennsylvania] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] became ill from eating tainted [mushrooms] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1255:5	The outbreaks were traced to [staphylococcus aureus] :[/PERSON] , a type of [bacteria] :[/PLANT] that produces a [toxin] :[/SUBSTANCE] capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning [vegetables] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1255:6	A recall of the [mushrooms] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] blamed for the food poisoning began in early March .

WSJ1255:7	In 1987 , [China] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] exported 65 million pounds of [mushrooms] :[/PLANT] , valued at $ 47 million , to the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1255:9	A spokesman for the [Chinese Embassy] :[/PERSON] here said that the [Beijing] :[/FACILITY] government has taken `` many effective measures '' to stop the [mushroom] :[/WORK_OF_ART] contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes .

WSJ1263:0	The management turnover at [Reebok International Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] continued with the resignation of company president [C. Joseph LaBonte] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , who joined [Reebok] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] just two years ago .

WSJ1263:1	Mr. [LaBonte] :[/PERSON] 's departure follows by two months the resignation of [Mark Goldston] :[/PERSON] as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1263:2	The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] insiders , reflect a difference in style with [Paul Fireman] :[/PERSON] , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .

WSJ1263:3	The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ 1.79 billion .

WSJ1263:4	The changes come as [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals [Nike Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [L.A. Gear Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1263:5	The departures , said [Alice Ruth] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , an analyst at [Montgomery Securities] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences .

WSJ1263:11	A former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems , adding : `` If you see any company that grows as fast as [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] did , it is going to have people coming and going . ''

WSJ1263:12	[Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] said Mr. [LaBonte] :[/PERSON] will resume the presidency of [Vantage Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 .

WSJ1263:13	Before that he was president and chief operating officer of [Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1263:14	[Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] added that Mr. [Fireman] :[/PERSON] will assume the title of president .

WSJ1263:15	A spokesman said that neither Mr. [Fireman] :[/PERSON] nor Mr. [LaBonte] :[/PERSON] would be available for comment .

WSJ1263:17	Mr. [Goldston] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , who had been president of [Faberge Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Faberge U.S.A.] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] division before joining [Reebok] :[/ORGANIZATION] in September 1988 , left in August to pursue other interests .

WSJ1264:2	At the [American Magazine Conference] :[/ORGANIZATION] here , publishers are plenty worried about the industry 's woes .

WSJ1264:4	[Telemedia Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will publish [Eating Well] :[/GPE] , a new food and health magazine due out next summer .

WSJ1264:5	[Hearst Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] this fall plans to publish its first issue of [9 Months] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , a magazine for expectant mothers , and has already launched [American Home] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1264:6	And [Time Warner Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] is developing a spinoff of [Time] :[/ORGANIZATION] magazine aimed at kids , on the heels of its successful [Sports Illustrated] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] for Kids .

WSJ1264:7	Over the past four years , the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually , according to [Donald Kummerfeld] :[/PERSON] , president of the [Magazine Publishers of America] :[/LAW] .

WSJ1264:8	`` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said Mr. [Kummerfeld] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1264:11	For the first nine months , advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the [Publishers Information Bureau] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] increased 4 % from the same period last year , to 125,849 pages .

WSJ1264:15	Within the same nine months , [News Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] closed down [In Fashion] :[/SUBSTANCE] , a once-promising young woman 's fashion magazine , [Drake Publications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has folded the long-troubled [Venture] :[/LOCATION] magazine , and [Lang Communications] :[/PERSON] has announced [Ms.] :[/PERSON] magazine , after 17 years , will no longer carry advertising as of January .

WSJ1264:16	[Lang] :[/PERSON] is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue .

WSJ1264:17	Meanwhile , [American Health Partners] :[/PERSON] , publisher of [American Health] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] magazine , is deep in debt , and [Owen Lipstein] :[/PERSON] , founder and managing partner , is being forced to sell the magazine to [Reader 's Digest Association Inc] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] .

WSJ1264:18	Mr. [Lipstein] :[/PERSON] 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble .

WSJ1264:19	Mr. [Lipstein] :[/PERSON] said in a telephone interview from [New York] :[/GPE] that the sale was proceeding as planned .

WSJ1264:21	It 's simply the right time to do what we are doing , '' Mr. [Lipstein] :[/PERSON] said .

WSJ1264:22	`` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said [James Autry] :[/PERSON] , president of [Meredith Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's magazine group .

WSJ1264:26	More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as [American Express Publishing Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [American Express Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , and [Conde Nast Publications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of [Advance Publications Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .

WSJ1264:28	[Gerry Ritterman] :[/PERSON] , president of New York-based [Network Publishing Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , earlier this year sold his [Soap Opera Digest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] magazine to [Rupert Murdoch] :[/PERSON] 's [News Corp .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1264:29	Mr. [Ritterman] :[/PERSON] said that in the next six months he will take $ 50 million from the [Soap Opera Digest] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sale to acquire new magazines .

WSJ1264:31	`` The magazines I am looking for are underdeveloped , '' said Mr. [Ritterman] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1267:0	In a nondescript office building south of [Los Angeles] :[/LOCATION] , human behavior is being monitored , dissected and , ultimately , manipulated .

WSJ1267:4	[Donald Vinson] :[/PERSON] , who oversees the experiments , is n't some white-coated researcher .

WSJ1267:5	He heads [Litigation Sciences Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate [America] :[/LOCATION] prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions .

WSJ1267:6	In the process , [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law .

WSJ1267:7	[Litigation Sciences] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a unit of Saatchi & amp ; Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians .

WSJ1267:12	Recently , [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] helped [Pennzoil Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] win a $ 10.5 billion jury verdict against [Texaco Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1267:13	It advised the [National Football League] :[/ORGANIZATION] in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by [the United States Football League] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1267:14	And it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from [Firestone] :[/PRODUCT] [500] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] tires to the anti-nausea [drug] :[/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/SUBSTANCE] [Bendectin] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1267:15	Largely as a result , [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] has more than doubled in size in the past two years .

WSJ1267:18	Mr. [Vinson] :[/PERSON] estimates the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million .

WSJ1267:22	In the film classic `` [Twelve Angry Men] :[/WORK_OF_ART] , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror 's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict .

WSJ1267:25	Litigation consulting is , as [New York] :[/GPE] trial attorney [Donald Zoeller] :[/PERSON] puts it , `` highly manipulative . ''

WSJ1267:29	But Mr. [Zoeller] :[/PERSON] also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective .

WSJ1267:32	`` The affluent people and the corporations can buy it , the poor radicals { in political cases } get it free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system we want , '' says [Amitai Etzioni] :[/PERSON] , a prominent sociologist who teaches at [George Washington University] :[/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1267:34	The [Harrisburg 7 trial] :[/EVENT] in 1972 , in which [Daniel Berrigan] :[/PERSON] and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence , was a landmark .

WSJ1267:35	In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around [Harrisburg] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ1267:37	The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the [Vietnam War] :[/EVENT,/EVENT/WAR] .

WSJ1267:41	The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when [International Business Machines Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case .

WSJ1267:42	The problem for [IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] trial lawyers [Thomas Barr] :[/PERSON] and [David Boies] :[/PERSON] was how to make such a highly technical case understandable .

WSJ1267:45	He then briefed Messrs. [Boies] :[/PERSON] and [Barr] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly .

WSJ1267:47	Mr. [Vinson] :[/PERSON] , the professor , got the law bug and formed [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1267:48	( [IBM] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] won the case . )

WSJ1267:49	[Boies] :[/PERSON] of Cravath , Swaine & amp ; Moore .

WSJ1267:52	The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which [Energy Transportation Systems Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] sued [Santa Fe Pacific Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION] over the transport of semi-liquefied [coal] :[/SUBSTANCE] -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over .

WSJ1267:53	[Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow .

WSJ1267:55	The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for [Energy Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , and awarded $ 500 million in damages .

WSJ1267:56	The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million victory for [Energy Transportation .] :[/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1267:57	[Energy Transportation] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] trial attorney [Harry Reasoner] :[/PERSON] of Vinson & amp ; Elkins .

WSJ1267:59	Forecasting is only one part of [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] ' work .

WSJ1267:63	Instead , Mr. [Vinson] :[/PERSON] says , interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views .

WSJ1267:66	Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a deli would be ideal , [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] advises .

WSJ1267:68	( Since [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] generally represents the defense , its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury . )

WSJ1267:69	For personal-injury cases , [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve .

WSJ1267:72	[Litigation Sciences] :[/ORGANIZATION] does n't make moral distinctions .

WSJ1267:74	As Mr. [Vinson] :[/PERSON] explains it , `` We do n't control the facts .

WSJ1267:80	More important are what [LSI] :[/PERSON] calls `` psychological anchors '' -- a few focal points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level .

WSJ1267:86	`` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight , '' Mr. [Vinson] :[/PERSON] has written .

WSJ1267:87	Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] ' operation .

WSJ1267:91	They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains [LSI] :[/WORK_OF_ART] graphics specialist [Robert Seltzer] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1267:94	`` They may not have been able to articulate it all , but they did it , '' says [Stephen Gillers] :[/PERSON] , a legal ethics expert at [New York University] :[/ORGANIZATION] law school .

WSJ1267:99	[Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions .

WSJ1267:100	A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant ( not at [Litigation Sciences] :[/PERSON] ) $ 70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in [The American Lawyer] :[/WORK_OF_ART] magazine .

WSJ1267:102	[Barry Ostrager] :[/PERSON] of Simpson Thacher & amp ; Bartlett , who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against [Shell Oil Co .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1267:106	For more than a decade , Mr. [Etzioni] :[/PERSON] , the sociologist , has been a leading critic of the masseurs .

WSJ1267:113	Mr. [Etzioni] :[/PERSON] also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors .

WSJ1267:117	Mr. [Boies] :[/PERSON] , the first lawyer to use Mr. [Vinson] :[/PERSON] 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning ( known as voir dire ) or giving out personal information about the jurors .

WSJ1267:118	`` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective , and I do n't think courts should lend themselves to that , '' Mr. [Boies] :[/PERSON] says .

WSJ1271:0	About 400,000 commuters trying to find their way through the [Bay area] :[/LOCATION] 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways , sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday .

WSJ1271:1	In other words , it was a better-than-average [Manhattan] :[/LOCATION] commute .

WSJ1271:3	The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the [Bay Bridge] , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from [Highway 101] , the biggest artery to the south .

WSJ1271:4	It will take several weeks to repair the bridge , and several months to repair some of the [101] connections .

WSJ1271:5	But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the [Bay Area Rapid Transit] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal .

WSJ1271:6	For the first time in memory , it was standing-room only in [BART] :[/GPE] 's sleek , modern railcars .

WSJ1271:7	Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] with the [East Bay] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .

WSJ1271:9	Many commuters who normally drove across the [Bay Bridge] , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on [BART] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations .

WSJ1271:10	In the best of times , the [Bay Bridge] is the worst commute in the region , often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more .

WSJ1271:12	Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway , and many commuters had to find rides to [BART] :[/ORGANIZATION] 's stations , because parking lots were full before dawn .

WSJ1271:13	Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as [Marilyn Sullivan] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1271:14	Her commute from [Petaluma] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Calif.] :[/GPE] , normally takes an hour and 15 minutes , via the [Golden Gate Bridge] , which connects [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] with the [North Bay] :[/FACILITY] area .

WSJ1271:18	But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the [Golden Gate] , by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out .

WSJ1271:19	`` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said [Charles Catania] :[/PERSON] , an insurance broker on the bus from [Mill Valley] :[/FACILITY] in [Marin County] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1271:22	However , a spokeswoman for [BankAmerica Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said yesterday 's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day .

WSJ1271:23	At the [San Mateo Bridge] , which connects the [San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] peninsula with the [East Bay] :[/FACILITY] , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .

WSJ1271:24	`` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated , '' said [Stan Perez] :[/PERSON] , a sergeant with the [California Highway Patrol] :[/PERSON] .

WSJ1271:26	The [Golden Gate] handled as many cars as normally yesterday , but over four hours rather than the usual two-hour crush .

WSJ1271:27	[Bechtel Group Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work .

WSJ1271:28	Of [Bechtel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's 17,500 employees , about 4,000 work in [San Francisco] :[/GPE] -- one-third of them commuting from stricken [East Bay] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1271:29	[San Francisco] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .

WSJ1271:30	.

WSJ1271:32	At [Pacific Telesis Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , flextime is left up to individual working groups , because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business hours , a spokeswoman says .

WSJ1271:34	One senior vice president at [Bechtel] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said he got up at 3 a.m. to drive into [San Francisco] :[/GPE] from the [East Bay] :[/FACILITY] .

WSJ1271:36	Although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing `` an anti-social act , '' about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the [Golden Gate] were alone , compared with the normal 70 % rate .

WSJ1272:0	[Garry Kasparov] :[/PERSON] went to combat Sunday with the world 's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around -- symbolically , anyway -- like an old tin can .

WSJ1272:1	Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered [Deep Thought] :[/PERSON] , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position .

WSJ1272:3	And in the second game , with Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] advancing ferociously as white , D.T . offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .

WSJ1272:5	.

WSJ1272:6	And when Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] strode into the playing hall , he called the outcome .

WSJ1272:7	As if he were [Iron Mike] :[/PERSON] , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years . ''

WSJ1272:8	His strategy against D.T . was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games , he said , including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters [Bent Larsen] :[/PERSON] of [Denmark] :[/GPE] and [Robert Byrne] :[/PERSON] of the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1272:9	Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] was underwhelmed .

WSJ1272:12	[Feng-hsiung Hsu] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , nicknamed his brainchild `` [the Weasel] :[/WORK_OF_ART] '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .

WSJ1272:13	D.T . also has a prodigious and flawless memory , is utterly fearless , and could n't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall , in the [New York Academy of Art] .

WSJ1272:14	In fact , D.T . never left home , [Carnegie Mellon University] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] in [Pittsburgh] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link .

WSJ1272:15	They conceded that the odds favored Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] , but they put their hope in D.T . 's recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second , from 720,000 .

WSJ1272:16	But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed [kryptonite] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1272:17	This became apparent as game one , a Sicilian Defense by Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] , proceeded .

WSJ1272:18	No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .

WSJ1272:19	After eight moves by each side , the board was the same as in a game in which [Nigel Short] :[/PERSON] of [Great Britain] :[/GPE] fought the champion to a draw in 1980 .

WSJ1272:20	But the computer did n't play Mr. [Short] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .

WSJ1272:22	`` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said [Edmar Mednis] :[/PERSON] , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans .

WSJ1272:24	It allowed Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T . 's knights .

WSJ1272:25	Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights , but in this case Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T . 's surviving bishop was reduced to passivity .

WSJ1272:30	While D.T . shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .

WSJ1272:32	No amount of weasling could have saved this game for [D.T .] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION]

WSJ1272:34	Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative [blood] :[/SUBSTANCE] , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] could win game two .

WSJ1272:35	With the advantage of playing white ( which moves first ) , Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] followed up cleverly against the computer 's defense , a Queen 's Gambit Accepted .

WSJ1272:36	As early as move six , Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight .

WSJ1272:38	`` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] said later .

WSJ1272:43	Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] remarked later that `` even a weak club player '' would have avoided the queen move .

WSJ1272:45	On a demonstration board , emcee [Shelby Lyman] :[/GPE] showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice ; no spectator refuted this line of play .

WSJ1272:46	Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .

WSJ1272:49	And Mr. [Kasparov] :[/PERSON] , to cheers and applause , marched back into the analysis room .

WSJ1272:53	Indeed , three of them will be building a successor machine for [International Business Machines Corp] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1272:54	Promises [Feng-hsiung Hsu] :[/WORK_OF_ART] : `` In three years we 'll mount a better challenge . ''

WSJ1272:55	Mr. [Tannenbaum] :[/PERSON] is a reporter in the [Journal] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's [New York] :[/ORGANIZATION] bureau .

WSJ1273:1	Just ask [Richard Blumenfeld] :[/PERSON] , a [New Jersey] :[/GPE] dentist who considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor . ''

WSJ1273:2	[Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] gave Merrill Lynch & amp ; Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % .

WSJ1273:3	`` It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly , '' Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/PERSON] recalls .

WSJ1273:4	Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] notes were paying less than 8 % .

WSJ1273:6	But nearly 3 years later , [Merrill] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's $ 40,000 .

WSJ1273:8	Instead , his [Merrill] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .

WSJ1273:11	Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4 % when it was issued in 1984 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then , part of the price Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD 's increased market value .

WSJ1273:12	Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .

WSJ1273:13	The tip-off came when he opened a recent [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] statement and found that the CD 's `` estimated current market value '' had plummeted by $ 9,000 in a month .

WSJ1273:17	Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] is n't unique .

WSJ1273:19	[John Markese] :[/PERSON] , research director of the [American Association of Individual Investors] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a Chicago-based educational group .

WSJ1273:21	Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying .

WSJ1273:22	He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs ( Treasury Income Growth Receipts ) , a type of zero-coupon [Treasury] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] security sold by [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1273:24	The broker , [Thomas Beairsto] :[/PERSON] of Merrill Lynch 's [Morristown] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [N.J.] :[/GPE] , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] officials in [New York] :[/GPE] .

WSJ1273:28	Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .

WSJ1273:30	[Salina] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Kan.] :[/GPE] , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] paid .

WSJ1273:32	`` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says [Albert Disposti] :[/PERSON] , a managing director of [Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1273:35	[Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] 's situation , although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years .

WSJ1273:36	[Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 .

WSJ1273:38	[Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs .

WSJ1273:45	Whatever the case , a [Merrill Lynch] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] spokesman emphasizes , investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless the bank or thrift that issued the CD is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .

WSJ1273:46	Dr. [Blumenfeld] :[/PERSON] says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .

WSJ1274:0	Americans are drinking less , but young professionals from [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] to [West Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] are rushing to buy premium-brand American [vodka] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [brandy] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and other [spirits] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1274:1	In particular , many are snubbing the [scotch] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] preferred by their parents and opting for [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] , the sweet [firewater] :[/PERSON] from the [Kentucky] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] countryside .

WSJ1274:2	With [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] liquor consumption declining steadily , many American producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad .

WSJ1274:3	And those efforts are paying off : Spirits exports jumped more than 2 times to $ 157.2 million in 1988 from $ 59.8 million in 1983 , according to the [Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.] :[/LANGUAGE] Council of the U.S. , a trade group .

WSJ1274:4	`` Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers , '' says [Michael Bellas] :[/PERSON] , president of [Beverage Marketing Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a research and consulting firm .

WSJ1274:5	`` If you want to be a player , you have to be in [America] :[/LOCATION] , [Europe] :[/LOCATION] and the [Far East] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1274:7	The internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies ' acquisitions of many [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] producers .

WSJ1274:8	In recent years , for example , [Grand Metropolitan PLC] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] of [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] acquired [Heublein Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , while another British company , [Guinness PLC] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] , took over [United Distillers Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] and [Schenley Industries Inc] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1274:10	While premium-brand spirits like [Smirnoff] :[/PERSON] [vodka] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] and [Jack Daniel 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] [whiskey] :[/SUBSTANCE] are riding high in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , domestic [spirits] :[/SUBSTANCE] consumption fell 15 % to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979 .

WSJ1274:12	[U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] [brandy] :[/SUBSTANCE] exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons , a standard industry measure , according to [Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group] :[/ORGANIZATION] , an industry association .

WSJ1274:13	Exports of [rum] :[/SUBSTANCE] surged 54 % to 814,000 proof gallons .

WSJ1274:14	[Mexico] :[/GPE] is the biggest importer of both [rum] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [brandy] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] from the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1274:15	[Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the world 's third-largest liquor market after the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] and [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported [spirits] :[/SUBSTANCE] and levied a tax on many domestic products .

WSJ1274:16	[California] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] wineries , benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies , are expanding aggressively into [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , as well as [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Great Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1274:17	In [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , the wineries are promoting their products ' [Pacific] :[/ORGANIZATION] roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs , whose recommendations carry weight .

WSJ1274:18	In [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , [Canada] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and [Greece] :[/GPE] , [Brown-Forman Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has increased its marketing of [Southern Comfort Liqueur] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1274:19	Using cinema , television and print ads , the company pitches [Southern Comfort] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] as a grand old [drink] :[/SUBSTANCE] of the antebellum [American South] :[/LOCATION] .

WSJ1274:20	The biggest foreign inroads , though , have been made by [bourbon] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1274:21	While [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] makers of [vodka] :[/SUBSTANCE] , [rum] :[/SUBSTANCE] and other [spirits] :[/SUBSTANCE] compete against powerhouses abroad , trade agreements prohibit any other country from making [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] .

WSJ1274:22	( All bourbon comes from [Kentucky] :[/GPE] , though [Jack Daniel] :[/WORK_OF_ART,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK] 's [Tennessee] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] [whiskey] :[/SUBSTANCE] often is counted as [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] because of similarity of taste . )

WSJ1274:23	Moreover , just as [vodka] :[/SUBSTANCE] has acquired an upscale image in the [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] , [bourbon] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] has become fashionable in many foreign countries , a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore .

WSJ1274:25	With a six-shooter in one hand and [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] in the other .

WSJ1274:26	`` We imagine with [bourbon] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] the [Wild West] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing , '' says [Kenji Kishimoto] :[/PERSON] , vice president of [Suntory International Corp.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a division of [Suntory Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's largest liquor company .

WSJ1274:27	[Suntory] :[/WORK_OF_ART] distributes [Brown-Forman] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] [bourbons] :[/PRODUCT] in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ1274:28	[Bourbon] :[/WORK_OF_ART] makes up just 1 % of world-wide spirits consumption , but it represented 57 % of [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION] liquor exports last year , according to [Jobson] :[/PERSON] ; no other category had more than 19 % .

WSJ1274:29	Big [U.S.] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] distillers are fiercely vying for this market , which grew to $ 77 million last year from $ 33 million in 1987 , according to government figures .

WSJ1274:30	[Jim Beam Brands Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION] , a division of [American Brands Inc.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , is the leading exporter of [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] and produces 10 other types of [liquor] :[/SUBSTANCE] .

WSJ1274:31	The company says it will increase its international advertising 35 % in 1990 , with [bourbon] :[/GPE] representing most of that amount .

WSJ1274:32	[Guinness] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's [Schenley Industries] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] unit has increased its TV advertising in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and has built partnerships with duty-free shops throughout [Asia] :[/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION] , enabling it to install prominent counter displays .

WSJ1274:33	The company 's I.W . Harper brand is the leading [bourbon] :[/EVENT] in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , with 40 % of the market .

WSJ1274:34	[Bourbon] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] exporters have succeeded in [Japan] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] where other industries have failed , avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by allying themselves with local agents .

WSJ1274:35	[Jim Beam Brands] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] has a distribution partnership with [Nikka Whiskey Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , a distiller .

WSJ1274:36	[Seagram Co.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , which exports [Four Roses] :[/ORGANIZATION] [bourbon] :[/SUBSTANCE] , has such a link with [Kirin Brewery Co] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ1274:37	Some [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] makers advertise abroad as they do at home .

WSJ1274:38	To promote [Jack Daniel 's] :[/WORK_OF_ART] overseas , [Brown-Forman] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] uses the same photos of front porches from [Lynchburg] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Va.] :[/GPE] , and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops .

WSJ1274:39	[Jim Beam] :[/PERSON] print ads , however , strike different chords in different countries .

WSJ1274:40	In [Australia] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] , land of the outback , a snapshot of [Jim Beam] :[/PERSON] lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather .

WSJ1274:41	West Germans get glitz , with [bourbon] :[/PRODUCT] in the foreground and a posh [Beverly Hills] :[/GPE] hotel in the background .

WSJ1274:42	Ads for [England] :[/LOCATION] are artsy and irreverent .

WSJ0713:0	West German and French authorities have cleared [Dresdner Bank AG] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] 's takeover of a majority stake in [Banque Internationale de Placement] :[/ORGANIZATION] ( [BIP] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] ) , [Dresdner Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said .

WSJ0713:1	The approval , which had been expected , permits [West Germany] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's second-largest bank to acquire shares of the French investment bank .

WSJ0713:2	In a first step , [Dresdner Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] will buy 32.99 % of [BIP] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] for 1,015 French francs ( $ 162 ) a share , or 528 million francs ( $ 84.7 million ) .

WSJ0713:3	[Dresdner Bank] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it will also buy all shares tendered by shareholders on the [Paris Stock Exchange] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] at the same price from today through Nov. 17 .

WSJ0713:4	In addition , the bank has an option to buy a 30.84 % stake in [BIP] :[/ORGANIZATION] from [Societe Generale] :[/PERSON] after Jan. 1 , 1990 at 1,015 francs a share .

WSJ0715:0	[West Germany] :[/GPE] 's cost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.3 % in October from September and was up 3.3 % from a year earlier , the [Federal Statistics Office] :[/ORGANIZATION] in [Wiesbaden] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said .

WSJ0715:2	Preliminary cost-of-living data for the current month are calculated based on inflation data from the four largest West German states -- [Baden-Wuerttemberg] :[/ORGANIZATION] , [North Rhine-Westphalia] :[/LOCATION] , [Bavaria] :[/LOCATION] and [Hesse] :[/GPE,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE] .

WSJ0718:0	[Shell Canada Ltd.] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] said it plans to build a lubricants blending and packaging plant at [Brockville] :[/GPE] , [Ontario] :[/LOCATION] , with start-up scheduled for 1992 .

WSJ0718:1	A spokesman said the plant , which will replace older lubricant and grease manufacturing plants in [Montreal] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , will cost about 50 million Canadian dollars ( US $ 42.5 million ) to build .

WSJ0718:2	[Brockville] :[/GPE] is about 100 miles east of [Toronto] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] .

WSJ0718:3	[Shell Canada] :[/GPE] , an [oil] :[/SUBSTANCE] and [gas] :[/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE] producer and marketer , is a unit of [Royal Dutch\/Shell Group] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , an Anglo-Dutch concern .

WSJ0723:0	[European Community] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] employers fear that the [EC Commission] :[/PERSON,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] 's plans for a `` charter of fundamental social rights '' is a danger to industrial competitiveness .

WSJ0723:1	`` We do n't want [Brussels] :[/LOCATION] deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful , '' said [Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz] :[/PERSON] , secretary general of the employers ' confederation [Unice] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .

WSJ0723:2	[Unice] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] -- an acronym for the [Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] -- fears that the charter will force [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations .

WSJ0723:3	Workers and management , Mr. [Tyszkiewicz] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] said , would lose the `` flexibility and diversity '' that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions .

WSJ0723:5	It argues , as does [Unice] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] , that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level .

WSJ0723:6	[France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] social-affairs ministers on Monday , officials said .

WSJ0723:7	But the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] .

WSJ0723:9	Mr. [Tyszkiewicz] :[/PERSON] said the charter would put poorer [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] countries such as [Spain] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] and [Portugal] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] at a disadvantage .

WSJ0723:11	This , he warned , would prevent these countries from bridging the difference with their richer [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] brethren .

WSJ0723:12	Indeed , lower wages -- in [Greece] :[/GPE,/GPE/CITY] , they are a third of the [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] average -- are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries .

WSJ0723:13	Increasing labor costs , Mr. [Tyszkiewicz] :[/PERSON] argued , would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] market planned for after 1992 .

WSJ0723:14	But the [Unice] :[/PERSON] official said that producing a charter acceptable to both [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] and European industry is n't an unattainable goal .

WSJ0723:16	A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the [commission] :[/PERSON] a mandate to produce an `` action program '' detailing on what points [EC] :[/ORGANIZATION] member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter .

WSJ0723:17	This provision lies at the heart of the British and [Unice] :[/ORGANIZATION] fears of `` social engineering '' by the commission .

WSJ0723:18	One possible political solution , an EC official said , would be for the commission to present the action program in late November , before the adoption of the charter at a summit of [EC] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE,/SUBSTANCE/DRUG,/GPE/CITY,/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/LOCATION/REGION,/LOCATION,/LANGUAGE,/PRODUCT,/SUBSTANCE/FOOD,/SUBSTANCE,/WORK_OF_ART,/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/WORK_OF_ART/BOOK,/ORGANIZATION,/EVENT,/PRODUCT/WEAPON,/ORGANIZATION/EDUCATIONAL,/EVENT/WAR,/DISEASE,/PERSON,/FACILITY,/SUBSTANCE/CHEMICAL,/FACILITY/ATTRACTION,/GPE/STATE_PROVINCE,/PRODUCT/VEHICLE,/ORGANIZATION/POLITICAL,/WORK_OF_ART/SONG] governments on Dec. 8 and 9 .

WSJ0723:19	This would leave [Britain] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program .

WSJ0723:20	The charter was approved by the [EC Commission] :[/ORGANIZATION/GOVERNMENT,/ORGANIZATION] on Sept. 21 .

WSJ0723:21	[France] :[/GPE/COUNTRY,/GPE] 's Socialist government , which currently holds the council 's rotating presidency , is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 [EC] :[/GPE] states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the [French revolution] :[/EVENT] and its `` [Universal Declaration of Human Rights] :[/ORGANIZATION/CORPORATION,/ORGANIZATION] .
